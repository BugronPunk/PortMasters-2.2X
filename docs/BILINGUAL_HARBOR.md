# Bilingual Harbor

PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release prints in English and Mandarin Chinese. Every captain facing line is paired English to Mandarin. This document states the policy, the keying scheme, the fallback rules and the canonical glossary. It does not reproduce the pack. The pack is the source of truth for translated text.

## Where the pack lives

| Path                                                      | What it is                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/game/i18n/zh.json`                               | The language pack. Every translated leaf lives here.                                |
| `src/lib/game/i18n/index.ts`                              | The readers: `t`, `tFor`, `tId`, `tIdFor` and `listJoiner`.                         |
| `src/lib/use-language-preference.tsx`                     | The captain's pick, its storage and the provider that redraws the screen.           |
| `src/lib/game/ledger.ts`                                  | The ledger record. Lines are stored as facts and values, not as finished sentences. |
| `scripts/smoke/suites/67-theBilingualHarbor.ts`           | Holds the pack to its contract and walks every call site.                           |
| `scripts/smoke/suites/68-theLedgerReadsInYourLanguage.ts` | Holds the ledger and its reading surfaces to building the sentence at the read.     |

Do not copy the pack into documentation. A table of every string is a second copy that drifts. Link to the file instead.

## Keying scheme

The pack is one JSON object with metadata and nineteen groups:

`terms`, `phases`, `modes`, `difficulty`, `goods`, `food`, `crew`, `ports`, `paths`, `houses`, `renown`, `merits`, `tags`, `systems`, `moments`, `cards`, `ui`, `sentences`, `fragments`.

Each leaf is one pair:

```json
{ "en": "Harbor", "zh": "港湾" }
```

- The everyday reader is keyed by the English source text. A call site writes `t("Harbor")`, and the reader looks up that exact English string. The English literal stays in the source, where the smoke suite can see it.
- Cards are read by id rather than by text: `card.<id>.name` and `card.<id>.desc`, through `tId` or `tIdFor`. A card's words travel with the card.
- Sentence rows use a sweep and number id, such as `shell.001`, `room-a.115` or `lobby.233`. The id organises the pack and gives the check a stable name. Runtime still reaches the row by its English text.
- Fragments are short words and phrases joined into a sentence by a call site. They are keyed by English like any other leaf.
- The flat text map keeps the earlier leaf when one English string is carried twice. By-id reads are how two surfaces share one word and still differ: the Market phase chip reads 开市, while the market tab reads 集市 through `ui.market`. A duplicate without an id read is reachable only through the earlier leaf.
- A phase without a short entry uses its label.

## Runtime and fallback

The supported locales are `en` and `zh`. The default is `en`.

| Reader                       | Use                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `t(en, params)`              | The current process language, for the screen being drawn. |
| `tFor(locale, en, params)`   | A named language, for a server frame sent to one captain. |
| `tId(id, params)`            | A leaf by id, in the current process language.            |
| `tIdFor(locale, id, params)` | A leaf by id, in a named language.                        |
| `listJoiner(locale)`         | `、` for Mandarin, `, ` for English.                      |

Missing entries fail open:

- An English string with no leaf prints the English itself, in either language.
- An id with no leaf prints the id.
- A token the call did not fill stays on the page as written, braces included. A visible brace is a wiring gap that can be fixed; a silently deleted one is a sentence that reads almost right.

Completeness belongs to the check, not the runtime. Suite 67 walks every `t()`, `tFor()` and `tId()` literal in the source and refuses a literal with no leaf. It also refuses a row that has lost a language, a token that is malformed, a Mandarin leaf that invents a token the English does not carry, and any dash the copy rules forbid.

### Tokens

Tokens are written in braces and interpolated from the call's parameters:

```
{count} coins
{count}金币
```

- A token name is a plain identifier or a dotted identifier. It has no spaces and no nesting.
- Both languages carry the same token names for the values. The words between them may differ freely.
- Mandarin may drop a token the English carries. Mandarin may never invent one.
- English plural helpers such as `{pluralS}` and plural ternaries collapse into one Chinese form. Chinese has no plural.
- Lists join with `、` in Mandarin and `, ` in English. The separator is a language fact; the call site supplies the items.

### The captain's pick

The pick is stored in `localStorage` under `portmasters_language` and mirrored to the `pm_locale` cookie. The server reads the cookie at the socket handshake, because it composes some captain facing lines and has no other way to know which language the captain reads. The document's `lang` attribute follows the pick on the next render and on a fresh load.

The pick applies at once. A captain who changes language sees the game change under them rather than at the next voyage. The ledger is built at the read for the same reason: a stored sentence would freeze the language it was written in.

## Voice and register

The Mandarin edition of the game is the baseline. Its word wins wherever a Song era harbor register would puzzle more than it clarifies. Prefer the concrete trade word to a literary flourish, and prefer the word a captain would actually say.

These written exceptions are deliberate and should not be normalised away:

| English      | Mandarin | Why                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broker       | 掮客     | A living trade word. The edition's institutional word is 牙行, which does not fit the person slot. |
| Wages        | 工钱     | The word a captain says. The edition uses 工资 across the payroll family.                          |
| Convoy       | 镖行     | The old word for the protection trade, which is what the path sells.                               |
| Boon         | 机缘     | The established term in this interface. The edition's mechanic word is 福缘.                       |
| Golden Lotus | 金荷     | The same flower as 金莲 without the 潘金莲 association for modern readers.                         |
| Ocean Gambit | 暗潮     | A coined compound such as 沧海暗局 reads constructed.                                              |

Other rules:

- Address the captain as 你. Do not use 您.
- Keep the English's direct, dry tone. Do not add formality, jokes or explanation that the English does not carry.
- Do not invent a new classical compound when the edition already has a plain word.
- Keep the established product names: PortMasters, Sea Master, Captain's Legacy, the House names and the path names.
- The 67 crew names are transliterated in the pack in the register the roster already uses: Arabic, Persian, Indian, Chinese and European names side by side. Do not duplicate the list here.

## Capitalization and punctuation

- The English `en` string is the casing authority. Short labels and buttons are mostly title case; full sentences and tooltips are sentence case. A translation pass does not recase the English.
- Chinese has no capitalization. Do not simulate title case with Latin capitals.
- Proper nouns keep their established forms. A name that stays in Latin keeps its source casing.
- Mandarin prose uses full width punctuation: `，` `。` `：` `；` `！` `？` and full width parentheses.
- Mandarin writes the ellipsis as three ASCII dots, `...`. English leaves keep the form already in the source, which is usually a single ellipsis character and sometimes three dots. A translation pass does not change either.
- Code, HTML, CSS values, tokens and command text stay ASCII and are not translated.
- Card values use the tight form: `{cost}金币`, `2麻布`, `{rounds}轮`. Other prose keeps the spacing already in the leaf. Do not re-space numbers and units in a wording pass.
- Do not use em dashes, en dashes or doubled hyphens in captain facing copy. The smoke suite refuses them. A single hyphen inside a compound word is allowed.

## Phases and modes

The phase rail uses a long face and a short face. A phase with no short entry uses its label.

Chinese has no plural, so each pair collapses into one word and the sentence adapts.

## Ports and paths

## Changing the pack

1. Change the English source first. The English literal is the key, so changing it without adding the matching leaf leaves the old translation unreachable.
2. Add or update the leaf with the same `en` value and the reviewed `zh` value. Keep the group and the key in their existing order.
3. Preserve every token. Mandarin may drop a token, but it may not invent one.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm run test:smoke`. The build runs the tag, card, status and dead surface checks. The smoke suite runs the bilingual contract, the ledger reading and the rest of the battery.
5. Do not machine-translate a leaf into the pack without review. A leaf that reads correctly in isolation can break a sentence whose subject or classifier lives in another leaf.
6. Do not add a third language by editing JSON alone. `LOCALES` in `src/lib/game/i18n/index.ts` is the list the picker offers, the reader accepts and the checks walk. A new language needs that list, the pack and the picker copy together.

The ledger is not a normal string table. A ledger line stores the fact and its values, and the sentence is built at the read in the language the reader holds. A good's name, a path's name and a card's name travel with the sentence rather than being frozen into it. Suite 68 holds that rule at the ledger and at the three surfaces that read it.

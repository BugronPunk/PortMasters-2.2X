# PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: The Private Information Security Review

Ocean Gambit is the first mode in this
tree whose rules depend on things a captain is not allowed to know: an
alignment, a personal goal, an ally, a win verdict. Everything else the game
hides is hidden by being local, and this is hidden by being deliberate, so
the paths that carry those facts are worth reading on purpose rather than
trusting to have come out right.

This is that reading. It covers the three surfaces below, it records
what it found and what it fixed, and it names the boundaries that were
accepted on purpose. Two gates came out of it, and the last section says when
the whole review repeats.

A second pass added the private paths the first pass did not have: a frame carrying the host's mute list, delivered one captain at
a time, and a report row that names two captains and reaches no wire at all.
The two notes the first pass recorded rather than fixed are closed findings
now, with what closed them written where they were raised.

## Scope

Three surfaces:

1. **Every site that builds a broadcast payload.** Anything a whole harbor
   receives. There are 57 `io.to(...)` and `io.emit(...)` statements across
   28 files under `src/server/realtime`, and a twenty-ninth file, the chat
   module, carries the phrase inside a comment and no statement. The
   question asked of each is whether anything private can be inside the
   payload it sends. The two passes read the 50 statements across the 16
   files that existed when they ran; four files joined the surface after
   them, the extraction that moved the connection handlers one to a file
   moved statements between files without adding one, and the count has
   grown and moved again since, all of it recounted in the last section, so
   the count above is the surface as it stands rather than the pages that
   were turned. The last section records what the repeat rule makes of both.
2. **Every site that writes to the log array.** The session conversation,
   which lives in process memory for the length of a harbor's life and is
   deliberately never written to the database.
3. **The save path that trusts a client.** `PUT /api/game/state` writes what
   a client sends, by design, and a save is read by the whole table at the
   end of a voyage.

Out of scope, and named so it is not mistaken for covered: the account and
session layer beyond identity binding, and transport security. The shape of
the mute was out of scope in the first pass and is read in the second,
where the frame that carries it is added to the inventories
below, along with the report row beside it.

## Method

The private channel was read end to end by hand: the emitter, the wire type,
the client hook, and every caller. Identity binding was read at the socket
layer. The inventories below were taken exhaustively rather than sampled: the
broadcast payloads and the session log by reading every entry, and the save
path and the report row line by line.

Then the reading was turned into a gate, because a review that ends in a
document is a review that is true exactly once. `scripts/private-scan.ts`,
run as `npm run check:private`, holds eight rules:

1. One delivery path for a private entry. The event is handled in the
   emitter, the wire type, the client's one hook, and the suite that sweeps
   it. A fifth file is a second path nobody reviewed.
2. One reader of the alignment table. Only the module that deals the cards
   may read the rows back.
3. The win verdict is a property in four places: the balance reader, the
   operator window, the wire type and the combination instrument, whose
   whole reading is a count over rows that carry it.
4. No broadcast payload statement names a secret.
5. The one door authored copy reaches the browser as HTML, which is one
   component rather than a screen. The tutorial's pages are written as
   markup and one sentence wants a bold word in the middle of it, so the
   tree has a single `RichText` component that renders markup, and no
   other site may render it. Every other sentence in the tree is text.
6. The roster frame, which is the only thing in the tree that carries the
   mute list, goes out one captain at a time. A mute is the host's judgement
   of one captain, so a roster frame sent to a harbor is that judgement told to
   the harbor.
7. The draft frame, which carries a captain's hand, goes out one captain at
   a time for the sixth rule's reason. A hand dealt to a seat is that seat's
   information, and a draft view sent to a harbor channel lays every seat's
   cards in front of the table.
8. The bazaar board, which carries one captain's own view of the rumor rows,
   goes out one captain at a time for the sixth and seventh rules' reason. A
   standing row's direction belongs to its publisher until the market it
   moves has been drawn, so a board sent to a harbor channel hands the whole
   table the lean the feature exists to keep.

Its first run produced 25 findings, nearly all of them its own noise, and the
calibration is recorded in its header: `scripts/smoke/` was allowed as a
reader because a suite reading rows back is a test of the module rather than
a second production reader, the rules were narrowed to `src/` where they are
about what the product ships, and word matching was replaced with shape
matching after the first draft reported four clean broadcasts as leaks
because "ally" appears inside "finally". It was then proved not to be vacuous: a
probe file violating all five rules was written, the scan reported 9 findings
and exited 1, and the probe was deleted in the same command.

The second pass proved the sixth rule the same way rather than inheriting the
first pass's proof: a probe file that delivered the roster frame to a harbor was
written, the scan named the file and the line, reported 1 finding, exited 1,
and the probe was deleted in the same command, after which the scan read the
tree clean again. The rule keys on the event name at an emit statement plus an
allow list of emitters that reach one recipient, rather than on the mute field riding
beside it, because the defect it guards is not a payload that mentions the
list: it is the frame losing the captain it was addressed to.

The third pass added the seventh rule when the draft landed, and proved it
the same way: a probe file that delivered a draft frame to a harbor was
written, the scan named the file and the line at the emit statement, reported
1 finding, exited 1, and the probe was deleted in the same command, after
which the scan read the tree clean again. The rule is deliberately the sixth
rule's shape, because the thing being sent is the same kind of thing: a
frame whose audience is its privacy. It keys on the emit statement rather
than on the event name alone so that the four allowed delivery sites (the two
named emitters that reach one recipient, a reply on the asking socket, and a
`to(socket.id)` send, which is the same single recipient spelled the long
way) pass on their spelling rather than on their intent.

The suite's own reading of the same boundary was proved the same way, on a
copy of the tree rather than on the tree: with the draft's view changed to
a harbor broadcast for one run, the sweep reported the two seats it caught
and the run exited 1, and the copy was restored from the tree and read
clean again. The sweep keeps every frame both sockets at a draft table
receive, on every event rather than on the events the feature names, and
reads each hand it finds against the beat that hand belongs to, so a hand
that changes inside a single beat is a card that reached the wrong socket.

## The inventories

### 1. Broadcast payloads

57 statements, 28 files, with a twenty-ninth file, the chat module, carrying
the phrase in a comment and no statement. The two passes read the 50
statements across the 16 files that existed when they ran, and every one of
those was read for what it carries; the four files added since are named in
the last section, the extraction that moved the connection handlers one to a
file took 29 statements out of the composition root and into nine leaves,
which is one file off the surface and nine on with the total unchanged, and
the growth and the conclusion's split since the extraction are recounted
there too, so the count here is the surface as it stands rather than the
pages that were turned. The findings that matter are in the next section; what the inventory
establishes is the shape of the surface: the broadcasts carry harbor rosters,
chat lines, a voyage checkpoint, objective totals, barter and aid offers,
telemetry statuses, the audit reveal, and the end of voyage reveal. The two
that carry a secret are deliberate, and are listed under boundaries below.

The roster frame is the one entry the second pass changed, and it changed by
losing a recipient rather than a field: the count above is the count after
the change, because the frame is the same frame sent to one captain at a
time through `emitToUser` instead of to the harbor. The mute list it carries is
read by each captain as what they may see, which for most of a harbor is
nothing at all.

The phase clock added two fields to a payload that already existed rather than a payload
of its own: `phase:ready_update` now also carries the moment the harbor's seat
runs out and how long that seat was given, which is what every captain's
countdown is drawn from. Both are public to the table by design, since the
clock is on all of their screens at once and a deadline the harbor shares is
not a secret, and neither is derived from anything hidden: the deadline is
the server's own arithmetic over a length that is a constant in the tree.
The four clauses below were applied to it, and the one of them it touches is
the broadcast payload clause, which it satisfies by adding fields to a
statement already in this inventory rather than a statement of its own. The
single new broadcast statement is the harbor's own line explaining a move the
harbor did not vote for (`src/server/realtime/checkpoint.ts:303`), which
carries a sentence and a room id and nothing about any captain. No new path
trusts a client either: the departure a captain who had not acted takes is
computed by the same client authoritative engine the boundaries below
already accept.

### 2. The session log array

`src/server/realtime/chat.ts` holds two arrays: `roomChatLog` (line 79) and
`roomDirectLog` (line 83). Both are written through one function,
`appendBounded` (line 114), reached by `recordHarborMessage` (line 129) and
`recordDirectMessage` (line 136), and both are bounded at 200 lines
(`SESSION_LOG_LIMIT`, line 75). Reads are asymmetric on purpose: `harborLog`
(line 143) hands back the harbor's own conversation, while `directLogFor`
(line 151) filters on read to the lines the reader sent or received. The
filter is the design rather than the storage, which is what keeps one
captain's private thread from reaching another when a harbor is hydrated after
a reload. Both arrays are dropped when the harbor is restarted or torn down
(`clearSessionChat`, line 160). The lines here moved down by twenty when the
mute book's own unique violation reader joined this module; the readers and
the arrays are the same ones the pass read.

Nothing here needed a fix. It is recorded because it is the one place in the
product where private conversation is stored at all, and the next pass that
adds a line to it should know which array it is writing into.

### 3. The save path

`src/app/api/game/state/route.ts`. The `PUT` requires a session (line 114), a
membership row (line 125), and then writes what it was handed. The Ledger
Integrity Pass reads four numbers out of the blob (line 152) and marks the
row rather than rejecting it, which is deliberate: a captain must never lose
a voyage to a false positive, and an implausible save is a mark the features
that read standings can decline to trust.

Three properties hold around it. The verdict is judged against the harbor's own
`currentRound` rather than anything in the payload, which is the one number a
client cannot forge (line 148). The response shape is identical whether or
not the save tripped the guard, so a tampering client learns nothing about
whether it was caught (line 189). And the alignment table is not in a save at
all: alignments live in `VoyageRole` rows the server writes, which is why a
doctored save cannot invent one.

### 4. The report table

`Report` (`prisma/schema.prisma:526`) is the one record the second pass
added. Four columns and a moment: a harbor, a voyage, a reporter and a
target, with a unique constraint over the four, so one report per pair per
voyage is the table's own rule rather than a check standing in front of it.
The harbor and the two captains are bare strings with no relations, which is
the telemetry row's shape and holds for the same reason: the row is a record
about an account rather than a part of it, so nothing cascades, and the
operator's purge deletes the rows that name an account by hand, on the
reporting side and the reported side alike.

Nothing on the wire carries a report. The captain it names is not told, the
harbor is not told, and the only frame it produces is the acknowledgement to
the captain who filed it. With the mute, the second pass added no new private
channel at all; it added a record the game keeps and a frame that lost an
audience, which is why the review repeats over them rather than the suite
growing a sweep for them.

## Findings

### Medium, fixed: the detail popup trusted its clients

`player:detail:response` relayed whatever the sending socket said. Any
authenticated captain could emit one frame naming any `targetUserId` and any
`requesterId` and any harbor, and the server would push the payload to the
named account, anywhere in the tree, with a snapshot of the sender's
choosing in it. Nothing private leaked the other way, but a captain could be
handed a forged hold under another captain's name, which is the kind of
defect that makes the popup worse than not existing.

Fixed by holding the question. `player:detail:request` now verifies that the
target is a member of the asker's own harbor before forwarding, and writes the
pair down (`rememberDetailRequest`, `src/server/realtime/presence.ts:88`).
The response is relayed only if a question is waiting for that exact pair,
and only if the asker is still standing in the harbor the question was about
(`src/server/realtime/wiring/player-detail.ts:83`). The harbor and the requester on the
relayed frame are the ones the server wrote down, never the ones the
answering client sent. Holds expire after 30 seconds and are dropped with the
harbor on a restart or a teardown. Three branches of it are now exercised by
the smoke suite: the question and answer, a second answer to a consumed
question, and an answer to a captain who has left the harbor.

### Low, fixed: a manifest line was bounded in shape but not in size

`normalizeOrderFills` (`src/lib/game/audit.ts:82`) dropped entries that
could not be a fulfillment, but placed no bound on a port name, a good name,
the number of goods in a line, or a count. Since a fill is printed to the
whole table in an audit reveal and in the ledger at the end of a voyage, a
doctored save could put a paragraph of its choosing, or ten thousand items
in one line, in front of six captains at the moment they were watching.

Fixed with three bounds read off the game rather than picked: 32 characters
of text (the longest port name is fourteen), four kinds of good (the widest
order asks for three), and 999 units (the widest line asks for four). A line
over any of them is dropped rather than trimmed, because a half printed fill
reads as a smaller trade than it was. Both sides of each bound are checked in
the suite: what a real voyage produces survives, and what only a doctored
save could is dropped.

### Low to Medium, fixed: a save had no size limit

Any member of a harbor could write a save of any size, and the harbor pays for
it: the conclusion parses every blob at the table and the Manifest Audit
samples one, on the code path that has to finish before a voyage can end.

Fixed with a 64 KB cap (`SAVE_BODY_MAX`, same route, line 111), chosen from
measurement rather than taste: five real saves on a live database run 1.5 KB
to 3.5 KB, so the cap is around twenty times the largest real one and leaves
room for a long voyage, a big hold and a full ledger. An oversized save is
refused with a 413 before the write, so the good save already on the row
stays exactly as it was, which the suite checks.

### Low, fixed: there were no rate limits anywhere in `src`

Every entry point was capped in size and typed, and chat was capped at 1000
characters on all three paths (`CHAT_MESSAGE_MAX`,
`src/lib/realtime-endpoint.ts:22`), but nothing counted requests, so a captain
with a script could emit status frames or detail questions as fast as the
socket accepted them. The first pass recorded this rather than fixing it
because no single feature owned it and a limit invented then would have
been a number with no reading behind it. The same pass that shaped the mute
has that reading, so it is fixed here.

As fixed, `src/server/realtime/inbound-limit.ts` puts every incoming frame on
a token bucket per socket, installed in front of every handler
(`src/server/realtime/index.ts:288`): thirty frames in hand
(`inbound-limit.ts:56`) and ten a second earned back, both read off the client
this tree ships rather than picked. An idle captain in a voyage sends two
heartbeats per eight seconds, a captain trading sends two to nine frames a
second in clusters of up to three inside a hundred and twenty milliseconds, a
client mounting a harbor sends about nine frames in a hundred and fifty, and the
tightest legitimate loop the suite runs sends twelve frames a hundred
milliseconds apart. Thirty clears the largest burst with the mount storm and a
margin on top of it; ten a second sits at the highest sustained rate the app
itself produces, which is where a script emitting hundreds a second is held to
after its first thirty frames. A frame over budget is dropped rather than
queued, the captain is told once per socket through the channel refusals
already use rather than once per refused frame, which is what stops the limit
amplifying the flood it is limiting, and one line in the process log per
socket is the whole trace. Nothing is recorded as telemetry: a record is of a
voyage, and a client sending too much is not something a voyage did.

Its own limits, written down because a limit that reads as stronger than it is
is worse than none. It bounds how fast a socket may talk and says nothing
about what it says, so it is not a filter and does not stand in for one. It is
per socket rather than per account, so a captain who opens a second tab buys a
second budget. And it sits above every cadence the shipped client produces,
which is deliberate rather than a gap: a person playing the game cannot reach
it, and the thing it exists to bound is the scripted client. The suite checks
the shape rather than the number, and it reads it over a live socket: two
hundred frames from one socket are answered thirty times, the captain behind
them is told once, the next captain's twelve frames are answered twelve times,
and the flooded socket is answered again once the budget refills.

### Low, fixed: the mute was visible to the harbor

`mutedUserIds` rode `room:members` as a harbor wide broadcast, so every captain
in the harbor could see who had been muted, including the muted captain. The
first pass recorded it as a design a later pass should decide on purpose
rather than as a leak, since nothing secret was revealed about anyone, and
the later pass that shaped the mute is where it was fixed.

As fixed, the frame is delivered one captain at a time through `emitToUser`
(`src/server/realtime/chat.ts:222`), and the field means what that recipient
may see rather than what the harbor decided: the host is handed the list they
set, a silenced captain is handed their own row of it, and a captain who is
neither is handed nothing. No client shape changed, because both existing
readers already read the list that way, and the scan's sixth rule is what
keeps a later pass from turning the frame back into a broadcast.

## Boundaries accepted on purpose

These are not defects and were not fixed. Each has a reason, and the reason
is what a later reviewer should test rather than the fix.

**The engine is client authoritative.** A captain's own voyage is theirs to
compute, and the server does not resimulate it. The consequence is that a
modified client can play a voyage it could not have played, and the answer in
this tree is not prevention but consequence: the integrity pass marks the
row, the voyage conclusion reads the mark, and features that later read
standings can decline to trust it.

**The `game:status` allow list.** The heartbeat accepts a named set of
fields, so a client cannot write arbitrary JSON into a broadcast. The list is
the boundary: everything else a client sends on that event is dropped. The
round inside it is bounded as well as typed: it is read against the voyage's
own length before a report can move the checkpoint (`namesARoundOfTheVoyage`,
`src/server/realtime/wiring/status-heartbeat.ts`), so a frame naming a round
the voyage does not have, whether from a stale build or a modified client,
leaves the harbor where it stands.

**Two harbor wide carriers of a secret, both deliberate.**
`voyage:reveal` (`src/server/realtime/reveal.ts:40`) publishes every card at
the end of a voyage, because that is what the end of a voyage is for, and
`audit:reveal` (`src/server/realtime/audit.ts:249`) publishes two sampled
manifest lines during one, because the audit's whole value is that the table
sees them. Both are the mode's design rather than leaks of it, and both are
reachable only at their own moment.

**The win verdict and the alignment are on their own rows.** The chronicle
row carries both (`prisma/schema.prisma:343-344`), and the wire type does not:
the route that hands a captain their chronicles maps the row to a shape that
carries neither, and filters on the reader (`src/app/api/chronicle/route.ts:22, 50`).
That is the same allow list discipline the payloads follow, one layer down.

**The operator window is admin gated.** The one console that can read across
accounts refuses every action from a captain whose account row is not an
administrator, and the check is server side (`src/server/realtime/admin.ts:123`).

**Identity is bound on the socket, never read from a payload.** `auth`
resolves the account through `getUserFromToken` (`src/server/realtime/auth.ts:65`)
and writes the id onto the socket state (line 96). `room:join` verifies a
membership row before the seat is claimed
(`src/server/realtime/wiring/room-join.ts:60`). No handler in the
realtime layer reads a captain's identity out of the frame it was sent,
which is what makes "the sender is who they say they are" true by
construction rather than by review.

**The price, not the payment, is what the consent boards settle on.**
The escort, module and refit desks move money on the two captains' own
machines rather than through the server (`applyEscortSide`,
`applyModuleTradeSide`), and each side applies its own reading: the buyer
pays what the purse actually holds (`paid = max(0, min(fee, Gold))`), the
seller credits the price that was agreed, and each desk guards the press
beforehand (`canPayFee`, one reader in the engine's core) so only a purse that
moved between the press and the settle can meet the clamp. A buyer holding
5 Gold who takes a 100 Gold listing therefore pays 5 while the seller
banks 100, and the difference is created rather than transferred. That is
accepted for the reason every cross captain movement here is: the two
machines cannot see each other, each side must settle what its own save
can honestly hold, and the price is the agreement. The published fee
bounds (`CONSENT_FEE_MIN`, `CONSENT_FEE_MAX`) wall the per trade amount,
and the module suite pins the clamp deliberately rather than by accident.

**An escort claim is a report about a round, so a frame that crosses the
round's close is refused rather than settled against the new one.** The
claim handler rides the round rather than the phase
(`src/server/realtime/wiring/escort-contracts.ts`), a claim arriving
after the harbor has carried the round on meets "That contract was for an
earlier round.", and a claim reporting a raid that took nothing is dropped
silently, because there is no captain doing anything wrong. The loss a
frame takes by arriving late is accepted: settling cover against the
wrong round's raid would be the worse reading, and no other captain can be
moved by it.

**The bazaar does not check who may speak, and that line is deliberate.**
Being the Aroma lives in a save this server has never read, so the desk
checks everything about a rumor row that can be checked without one (its
shape, its bounds, the voyage round it names) and nothing about the
captain's path; the module's own header states the boundary at the code
(`src/server/realtime/wiring/bazaar.ts:35-40`) rather than leaving it to
a reader to find.

## The severity one bar

The evaluation for this review is that no alignment field can reach
the wrong client, at severity one. The verdict is that none does, and that
none did before the fixes either: the alignment table has three production
readers, all inside `src/server/realtime/gambit.ts` (lines 129, 186, 323),
and the only wire field that can carry an alignment is `role`, inside a
`PrivateEntry` that `emitPrivate` addresses to one captain's own sockets
(`src/server/realtime/presence.ts:60`). The set stayed three when the
charters landed at round four: the take reads the table through the same
module's own accessor, where the voyage's end was already the first caller
(`cardsInRoom`, called from `src/server/realtime/conclusion/voyage.ts:240`
and, for the take, `src/server/realtime/wiring/round-report.ts:129`), which
is a second caller rather than a fourth reader.

That verdict is now mechanical rather than remembered. Two sweeps in the
smoke suite read every frame every socket receives at two Gambit tables,
including a six captain table with two Pirates and an ally, and fail on any
frame but a dealt card that carries a role field, a flourish field, an ally
field, or an alignment word under any name. The sweeps are also required to
match the shapes they look for before they are pointed at a harbor, so a
pattern narrowed to nothing cannot pass by finding nothing.

## The closed test

The review's other half is a closed test: thirty players, none of them the
people who built the mode, on a database that has never held a real account.
The discipline is the smoke suite's, one size larger: the database is a
separate one, and the name says so.

`scripts/closed-test.ts`, run as `npm run check:closed-test`, is step zero of
that test. It refuses to bless anything but a local SQLite file whose name
begins with `closed-test`, it prints the name and the counts of what is
already inside, and it never prints any part of the database URL, because a
connection string can carry a password inside it and the guard's output is
meant to be pasted into a session log. It reads and counts, and it writes no
row and creates no table.

It deliberately does not contact a running server. The one route a script can
call without credentials answers from the process and touches nothing else,
by design, so it cannot say which database the server answering for it is
writing to; asking would be theatre. The run time proof that a server and the
script driving it share one database is the smoke suite's safety interlock:
the first account is created through the API, and the run stops before a
second one exists unless that account can be read back through the driver's
own connection.

When the test ends, the database is discarded. No row from it is copied
anywhere and it is never merged into anything holding real accounts. What
reads it needs no new instrument: the operator window and the voyage records
read a closed test the way they read any voyage.

## What the gates cannot catch

A gate that reads as stronger than it is is worse than none, so:

**The scan reads text, not meaning.** It cannot follow a value through a
variable, so a payload assembled in a helper and emitted later reads as clean
unless the emit statement itself names the secret. Rule 4 gathers an emit
statement up to eight lines, and a secret smuggled under a name the rule does
not know about passes it. That gap is covered on the wire rather than in the
text, by the sweeps above and by the adversarial sections of the suite.

**The sweeps only read the harbors the suite sails.** They cover two Gambit
tables and the windows in which those tables are watched. A third mode with
its own private channel would need its own table.

**The sixth rule reads an event name.** It matches `"room:members"` at an emit
statement and allows an explicit list of emitters that reach one recipient, so an event
name reached through a variable holding it passes, and so would a roster frame
sent through some other addressed emitter nobody has written yet. It guards
the regression it was written for rather than proving no second path exists,
which is the same gap rule 4 has and is written down for the same reason.

**The eighth rule reads an event name, and its gap is the sixth rule's.** It
matches `"bazaar:update"` at an emit statement and allows an explicit list of
emitters that reach one recipient, one spelling wider than the seventh rule's because two
files deliver this frame rather than one, so an event name reached through a
variable holding it passes, which is how the client's own hook names it, and
so would a board sent through some other addressed emitter nobody has written
yet. It guards the regression it was written for rather than proving no second
path exists, which is the same gap rules 4, 6 and 7 have and is written down
for the same reason.

**The budget bounds rate, not content.** Ten well formed frames a second are
allowed through, and every one of them is still read by the same handler and
the same sanitizer as before. It is not a filter, and it says nothing about a
captain who stays under it.

**The closed test guard checks a name.** It is the readable part of "a
separate database from anything with real accounts" and not the whole of it.
A database that is separate but misnamed is refused, and a database that is
wrongly named but separate is accepted; the interlock is what covers the
fact of separation at run time.

## When this review repeats

The rule, written here so nobody has to remember it: **a new private channel,
a new persisted secret, a new broadcast payload, or a new path that trusts a
client repeats this review before it repeats the closed test.** The same
sentence is in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` under the rules that must not be
broken, and `npm run check:private` is the part of it a command can hold.

It has been repeated once. The second pass added a persisted record about two
captains and changed the audience of a payload that had been arriving at the wrong one, so
it triggered on two of the four clauses at once. The second pass is recorded
on this page rather than in a document of its own, because a second reading of
the same surfaces is a second pass over the same page: the scope, the
inventories, the findings and the limits above now carry both.

**The surface has grown and moved since the second pass.** The passes read 50
broadcast statements across 16 files; the tree now carries 57 executable
statements across 28 files, with the chat module's comment beside them. The
growth came in small steps: four modules joined the surface (`bazaar.ts`,
`consent.ts`, `draft.ts`, `voyage-log.ts`), the checkpoint, the harbor join
and the public offers ledger added one statement each, and the connection
handlers moved out of the composition root into nine leaves under `wiring/`
without adding a statement. Two later changes left the count alone: the
Manifest Audit and the maroon now share one tally helper (`tally.ts`) instead
of keeping two copies of the same walk, and the fleet commission added a
grant addressed to one sender (`objective:granted`) whose payload is that
captain's own standing and nothing about any other seat.

None of the additions carries a private payload. The ledger broadcasts the
public record the design makes public on purpose, the checkpoint broadcasts a
deadline, the harbor join broadcast carries membership, and the shared tally
helper reports a count, a roster and a book the harbor is shown already. The
trigger stays met on the broadcast payload clause as a count rather than a
reading, so the repeat stays owed, and no reading has been taken over the
newer statements. That is stated here rather than implied by the numbers.

What guards the newer paths in the meantime is `npm run check:private`, whose
fourth rule reads the text of every broadcast payload statement for a secret
written into it. What that rule cannot do is the part this review exists for:
it reads the words of an emit rather than its meaning, so it catches a payload
that says role or flourish or ally or alignment and passes one that smuggles
the same value under a name nobody taught it.

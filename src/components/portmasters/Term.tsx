   * focuses a span only when the span can be focused. Radix opens the
   * tooltip on focus the same way it opens on hover, so the tab key and
   * the finger both work with no state of our own. It stays a span
   * rather than a button because it does nothing when pressed: the whole
   * of its job is to be described.
   *
   * False inside a control that is itself a button (the rail's leg rows
   * and the status panel's tabs): interactive content nested in a button
   * is invalid, and there the row's own press is the answer to a tap
   * anyway. The definition those two carry is still the same tooltip; it
   * just does not add a stop inside a control that already has one.

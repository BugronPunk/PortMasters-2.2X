/**
 * The captain's own rail.
 *
 * The handful of numbers that are checked every few seconds (round, waters,
 * Gold, reputation, and what is owed at round end) lead the column, and
 * everything else is a tab, so the ledger is a peer tab rather than a
 * footnote below the fold. Five sections stacked in one narrow column
 * (Captain's Log, Vessel Status, Cargo Hold, Outstanding Loans, Dues) would be an unavoidably long vertical scroll in a rail
 * roughly 260px wide, and the ledger, which a captain consults constantly,
 * would sit furthest from the eye.
 *
 * The panel is one scroll container at every window height, and the tabs are
 * laid out at their natural height inside it: scrolling the rail moves the
 * whole column, head included, and no section box ever owns a scrollbar of
 * its own (the ledger's tail box is the one deliberate exception, because a
 * log's whole job is to scroll its own newest lines into view). Whatever
 * the window, content taller than the rail scrolls the rail, and content
 * shorter than the rail does not scroll at all.
 *
 * The due figure in the head carries the safe/short tone, because that is the
 * one number that decides whether a captain is about to go bankrupt, and it
 * should be readable without opening anything.

// =====================================================================
// [F5: public offers] The Open Boons board: the fleet's ledger as a
// captain reads it.
//
// The plan's feature is one sentence, every offer is public, and this is
// the surface the sentence is about: one row per captain, the cards they
// were shown, and the one they kept. It is drawn where the picks happen
// (the Dawn draft, under the compass) and where the table argues about
// them (Parley, under the two votes), because those are the two moments
// the plan's evaluation names.
//
// It draws nothing at all in three cases and each one is deliberate: a
// Classic harbor runs no ledger (the same mode gate the hook and the
// server share), a voyage where no boon has been kept yet has nothing to
// say (a reader draws the line on a record and never on a placeholder),
// and the panel is not drawn by a phase that does not mount it. The kept
// card is marked by weight and fill rather than by hue alone, so the row
// still reads to a captain running the colorblind safe palette.
//
// The names come from the room's own roster rather than from the frame:
// the ledger carries ids and cards and nothing else (see
// @/types/realtime/boons), so this board cannot disagree with the
// captain list drawn beside it, and a seat the room no longer counts
// simply stops having a row.

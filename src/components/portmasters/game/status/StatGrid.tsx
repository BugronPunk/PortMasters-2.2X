/**
 * The four headline numbers of the pinned rail: Gold, reputation, and then
 * whatever the voyage is charging the captain at this moment, which is what
 * round end will take while a voyage is under way and the ship's class
 * before it starts. A Larder cell joins them while the provisions layer is
 * running. The rail reads these every few seconds and they never scroll, so
 * they are drawn as one grid whose width follows whether that fourth cell
 * exists.
 *
 * The cells sit two to a row rather than four, because the rail is a rail:
 * four across the width that leaves the stage the harbor it needs gives each
 * cell about fifty pixels, and the longest label in the set ("Reputation")
 * is wider than that on its own, so every cell would break its own word in
 * half. Two rows of two cost the pinned block one row of height and read as
 * a proper readout rather than as four abbreviations.
 *
 * The cells are the one tile at its rail scale, wash, figure and caption
 * included, because the rail used to keep its own copy of that shape and
 * the larder's cell was a second copy of the copy.

/* The weather is readable from here in
   every phase, which is the whole point of it: a captain decides
   what to wear at the bench before the round resolves, and the tag
   is worth nothing if it only surfaces in the settlement that has
   already happened. It is drawn on a cold round alone, because a
   mild one asks nothing of anybody, and it wears the meaning
   colours rather than a hue of its own: the sea while the crew is
   dressed for the weather, the alarm red the moment the clothes
   on their backs are not enough. The two sentences are authored in
   status-copy with the rest of the status lines (see
   coldRoundChipLine), and the Wardrobe panel on the bench prints the
   same sum from the same function. */

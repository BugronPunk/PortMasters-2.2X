/**
 * [D7: the draft, and switching] What this captain sails as.
 *
 * The identity is a line on the captain's own rail rather than a card in
 * the stage, and the reason is the company it keeps: round, waters, funds,
 * reputation and what round end will take are all readings about this
 * captain, and what they sail as is the sixth. In the stage it was a card
 * about a person standing in a column of cards about the table, and it cost
 * the board a slice of a column that has none to spare.
 *
 * The chip is the identity itself, in the words the path's own record uses
 * (see @/lib/game/paths), so a captain reading "Quartermaster" here reads
 * the same two words the locked order board and the fleet log use. A
 * captain who holds no path reads that instead, which is a real state
 * rather than an empty one, and it is three states rather than one: the
 * deal is open to them now, the deal is still to come, or the deal ran
 * before they came aboard and this voyage sails them without one (see
 * inDeal and the phase below). Each reads its own sentence, because one
 * sentence covering all three would tell two of them a future that is not
 * theirs; the switch is offered in none of them, since the engine refuses
 * a captain holding no path to set aside (see pathSwitchBlocked). Neither
 * state wears a section label above it: the chip already names itself,
 * the empty state already opens with "No path yet", and the label over
 * them was the same fact said twice on a rail that counts its rows.
 *
 * The switch lives behind the chip rather than open on the rail, and the
 * reason is that it is a rare move with consequences: a permanent row of
 * four other paths would be four buttons a captain never presses, taking a
 * third of a rail that has to hold a hold, a ship and a ledger. What the
 * chip opens says the whole price before the click, including the half of
 * it that is not a number: the forfeiture and the publication. That is the
 * plan's own design point read as a screen: "the price of changing your
 * identity is that everyone knows."
 *
 * What the popover prints of a refusal is the engine's own sentence
 * wherever the engine has one: the line above the buttons is the same
 * guard the press runs (see pathSwitchBlocked), so the reason a destination
 * is refused and the reason the engine would refuse it are one sentence
 * rather than two that could drift. The error under the chip is the harbor's,
 * and it carries the harbor's own two for the cases the engine is never
 * handed, a frame naming a path this build does not have and a build with
 * the switch off (see the path:switch handler).

/**
 * One held card on the rail: the card's own glyph and name, read through
 * the pool by id so a retuned card is the card a captain holds on the
 * next frame (the same resolution the effects themselves use, see
 * heldBoonCards). The effect line is the card's own English description,
 * which is the sentence the overlay that dealt it printed.
 *
 * The line lives on the tooltip and behind a
 * tap rather than in the row, because a rail counts its rows and five
 * full descriptions would be a paragraph in the middle of it. The tap is
 * the half a hover title cannot do: a touch screen never fires a title,
 * so the chip is a button that opens the line under the row, one card at
 * a time so the rail's height stays a reading rather than a wall.
 *
 * One chip for both kinds of held card, because the dress is the row's
 * rather than the card's: a boon and a charter sit side by side here and
 * a second copy of the same six classes is the file asking a reader to
 * diff two identical spans.

/**
 * What the moments have left in this
 * captain's hands, at the top of the captain's own rail.
 *
 * A row on the rail rather than a card in the stage, for the reason the
 * path chip beside it gives: these are readings about this captain, and
 * the stage belongs to the board the fleet is working. The row sits under
 * the chip because the two answer the same question in the same words,
 * what this captain carries for the rest of the voyage.
 *
 * The voyage's charter rides the same row,
 * read through the same held card readers (see heldCharterCard) and
 * wearing the same chip: it is a card this captain took and carries for
 * the rest of the voyage, which is exactly what this row answers. It is
 * deliberately not read through its own switch, for the boons' reason:
 * a held effect rides the voyage even in a build that rolled the moment
 * back (see chartersOn), so a chip hidden behind the switch would be the
 * rail lying about an effect the captain still holds. It is appended
 * rather than prepended, so it never pushes the boon chips sideways the
 * round a captain answers it.
 *
 * It draws nothing when nothing is held, which covers two ordinary
 * screens: a captain early in a voyage, and every screen in a harbor that
 * never arms a moment. The boons half is deliberately not read through
 * the switch either: the design's rollback keeps held boons riding for the
 * voyage (see milestoneBoonsOn), so a row hidden behind it would be a
 * screen lying about effects the captain still holds.

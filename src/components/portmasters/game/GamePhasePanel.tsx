/**
 * The dispatcher for every phase screen. Every phase is its own module
 * under ./phases and a module level export, so a stable component
 * identity holds across renders and React renders the phase in place on
 * every game state update instead of unmounting and remounting the whole
 * subtree, which would reset local useState mid interaction (see the
 * ReadyFooter comment in PhaseShared.tsx for the failure this avoids).
 *
 * The motion wrapper runs one sync transition: a fresh
 * `${phase}:${currentRound}` key swaps the subtree in one tick, so a
 * phase change reads as one cross fade rather than a stack of
 * overlapping panels.
 *
 * The dispatcher takes the shared `PhasePanelProps` shape, plus the
 * optional extras its own `Props` type adds for the overlays and
 * payloads not every caller wires up, among them `onTutorialOpen`
 * (used by the Welcome screen's New Captain Tutorial button) and
 * `voyageResult` (the harbor wide standings payload the server emits on
 * voyage:complete, also consumed by Endgame). Each is optional so a
 * caller that hasn't wired one in still compiles and renders a sensible
 * default.

// a hook, because the frame carrying it is the conclusion's own and both

   Two pairs do share a hue, and neither pair can ever be on screen
   together: bankruptcy wears Dawn's hue because a voyage that ends there
   never reaches another boon draft, and endgame wears the Module Draft
   hue because a crowned voyage has drafted its last module. Those two

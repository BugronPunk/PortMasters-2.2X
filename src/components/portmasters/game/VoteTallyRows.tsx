// =====================================================================
// The count, and who named whom, drawn once for the harbor's two votes.
//
// The Manifest Audit and the maroon vote both put a target to the table
// and both show the harbor the nominations as they come in. The rows are
// tallyRows' (see lib/voteTally.ts, which is where the two votes already
// share what a row is); this is the other half of that arrangement: the
// same paragraph, the same two spans, the same muted count, in two
// panels.
//
// The whole block reads out of the census the server sends rather than
// out of arithmetic here: the roster a vote divides by is the server's
// active roster, which is not the member list a client can see (see
// AuditTally). How many captains have named someone of how many the vote
// is divided by, how many names carry it, each target with the names
// behind them, and who the harbor is still waiting on.
//
// Nothing is counted without a census. A harbor whose count has not arrived
// yet is told exactly that, because a count block guessing at its own
// denominator would be a wrong count in a longer sentence. The shortfall
// line (how many more names the leading target needs) and the captain's
// own line (whether their name is in) are arithmetic over the same frame
// the rows come from, so there is no fourth number to keep in step.
//
// The count line is worded for its own number: one captain has named
// someone, five have, one name carries it. The count half is built by the
// shared builder (see namedCountLine in lib/voteTally.ts), so the two
// votes cannot word one number two ways.
//
// The last line is the one thing here the count cannot supply: what
// happens when the names the vote needs land on one captain, and who is
// still to act. Every word of it is the vote's own rather than the
// block's, because the audit and the maroon spend different things, so it
// arrives as a function of the threshold (see nextStep) rather than as
// copy this file would have to keep two versions of. It reads the
// threshold the census carries, so the number a line names and the number
// the server carries on are one rule (see auditNamesNeeded, and the
// maroon's own count).

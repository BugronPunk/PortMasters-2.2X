// The reveal, and the ledger that follows it.
//
// This is the last thing the mode does and the one moment it was built
// around: every card in the harbor turned face up in front of the table.
// It is drawn from a single frame the server sends once the voyage is
// over, because the client never held anybody else's card and never will.
// That is not a detail of the plumbing, it is the shape of the panel: it
// is the first time this browser is told anything at all about the five
// other seats, and it prints what it was sent rather than working any of
// it out.
//
// The ceremony is a stagger, one card every REVEAL_STAGGER_MS in the
// order the standings arrived in, which is the beat the design asks for and
// the reason this panel is not a table. It is skippable from the first
// second, because twenty five seconds of theatre is a joy on the first
// voyage of an evening and a hold up on the fourth, and either way the
// host is waiting to start the next one.
//
// The ledger below it is the honest half of the design's sentence. What is
// durably recorded of a finished voyage is the commission's progress round
// by round, the order fulfillments each client kept, and the endings, so
// those are what it shows: the fleet's story across the voyage, then
// every trade left on the record with the traitors picked out of it.
//
// Nothing here renders in a harbor that dealt no cards.

// The harbor's vote card, drawn once for the two votes.
//
// The Manifest Audit and the maroon vote are the same interaction read
// twice: a captain is named, a count runs, and the harbor is told what the
// vote spends when it carries. The two cards were written out twice, and
// a card is where a captain looks to be told what a vote does, so two
// copies of it are two answers to one question.
//
// So the card is here, and each vote hands in its own words: the verbs
// its picker is pressed with, the sentence its rule is printed in, the
// line its count ends on, and what it spends. What the card owns is the
// shape: the shell, the picker, the refusal line, the count's place and
// the note under it.
//
// The parts that differ stay with the vote that owns them. The audit
// reveals a manifest and the maroon puts a captain ashore, and neither
// panel's file decides anything about the other.

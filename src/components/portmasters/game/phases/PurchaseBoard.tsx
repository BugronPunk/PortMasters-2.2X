/**
 * The port board itself: every card this round's market is offering, in
 * the grid the port merchant exchange reads them in. It owns no state and
 * asks the game nothing the cards do not answer for themselves, which is
 * why it is a map and a grid and very little else.
 *
 * The columns it deals are the stage's, not the window's. The board is
 * drawn in the middle column of the harbor, so a breakpoint read off the
 * window answers a question nobody asked: at a window wide enough for the
 * old three across rule the stage is still a single column of the harbor, and
 * three cards dealt into it wrapped every goods line and every chip they
 * had. The stage is a container (see the harbor's own note), so this measures
 * the harbor it is actually drawn in: one column while the stage cannot hold
 * two cards, two while it can, and three once each card still has the width
 * the goods rows want. The bottom margin is the panel rhythm the rest of
 * this screen keeps, because each panel here carries its own.

/**
 * Module interaction rules. Each rule names a set of module IDs and the
 * interaction they produce, and the analyzer checks whether every ID in a
 * rule is equipped. Adding an interaction is one entry here.
 *
 * These are the only hand written part of the analyzer, because an
 * interaction is exactly the thing neither module's own catalogue entry
 * can state: each is a claim about what two of them do together. The
 * names inside those claims are not hand written: they are asked of the
 * records through cardName, so a card renamed for its captain is renamed
 * here the same afternoon. A hand written label drifts, calling the Tax
 * Evasion Ledger, the Bulk Hauler Rigging and the Maritime Bureau Token
 * by shorter forms and the Ocean Interpreter by the words of its own id.
 *
 * Every rule pairs hull cards. A boon cannot be a participant: the
 * equipped set this analyzer reads holds what is installed on the ship,
 * and a boon writes the round's flags instead, so the rule that paired
 * the Persian Dome Compass with the Deep Sea Escort Pact could never
 * fire and is gone. The pairing is real in play; this panel simply
 * cannot see the boon half of it.

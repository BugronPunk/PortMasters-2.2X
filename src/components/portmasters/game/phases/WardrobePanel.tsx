// The Wardrobe. The clothes the crew wears into the cold.
//
// [C3: garments and the cold] It sits on the artisan bench rather than on
// the port board, and the reason is the inventory block above it: this is
// the one screen where a captain sees the crew and the hold together, and
// the goods this panel draws from are the finished goods that block already
// lists. Nothing here is bought or sold, which is the other half of the
// reason it is not a market board panel: a garment reaches the wardrobe by
// being made at this bench, and the plan's own sentence about the Loom path
// is that there is no other way to get one.
//
// The panel is the whole of the durability mechanic a captain reads, and it
// is deliberately not a bar. What it prints is the multiplier the plan asks
// for: what each worn garment is worth today and what the crew's total comes
// to against what this leg asks. The decision is the button, and the line
// under the heading says what pressing it commits to, because a garment that
// goes on stays on until the sea has had it.
//
// Runs only when the layer is on. With the switch off the panel is not
// drawn, the wardrobe is not read and no button is offered, which is the
// base game.

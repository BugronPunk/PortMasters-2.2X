// The three beats, in the words a captain reads them in.

// One table rather than three lists, because the title, the line and the
// button label are one beat told three ways and a reader editing a beat has
// to see all three at once. The keys are the wire's own step names, so a
// fourth beat would be a compile error here rather than a blank card.
//
// The table keeps the English the pack is keyed on; the reads happen where
// the beat is drawn, because a t() call up here would freeze at whatever
// language the process started in.
//
// The lines are the plan's deal read out loud: "Keep one, pass two to the
// left, keep one of the two received, pass one, discard the last." The last
// beat says what the choice actually is, which is the reading this build
// settled on (see the header of src/lib/game/draft.ts): the two papers in
// front of a captain are their own two keeps, and the voyage is sailed on
// whichever of them they hold on to.
//
// There is no fourth entry for a settled view, because a settled view is
// not a beat: it is the result, and the panel draws nothing for it (see
// DraftStep on the wire).

/**
 * [W2: the path draft] The deal, drawn as the stage a dealing Gambit
 * departure opens at.
 *
 * The plan asks for this interface by name: "Forty five seconds with a good
 * interface is the target, so the interface is not an afterthought on this
 * one." So the panel is built around the two things a captain needs and
 * nothing else: the cards, and what to do with them this beat. Each card
 * wears its crest, its name, its own signature sentence and the few numbers
 * the record carries, because the choice the plan wants measured ("taking
 * it is a choice somebody makes rather than a duty somebody gets assigned")
 * is only a choice if the captain can read what they are choosing between.
 *
 * Two things this panel deliberately does not have, and both were field
 * findings rather than taste. There is no countdown: the harbor waits at this
 * seat for its captains, each step turns over when every seat has answered,
 * and a clock face here was telling captains a timer was deciding for them
 * when nothing of the sort was true (see DRAFT_WATCH_MS, which is a
 * reconnect window nobody is shown). And the cards are full width rows
 * rather than a grid of tiles: the same three offers in one row of narrow
 * columns is what made the last two steps feel like the table was taking
 * the options away, and a row that holds one card with harbor to read it is
 * the shape a captain can actually weigh. A hand of two rows the same size
 * as a hand of three is the point rather than a side effect.
 *
 * A captain who has laid their card down sees the wait instead of the rows,
 * which is the shape the boon draft takes: the picker goes away so the same
 * card cannot be laid twice, and what is left is the count of the table
 * still choosing. The count is the harbor's own number (see DraftView.open)
 * and it is painted from the frames the server sends as the other seats
 * answer, so it moves while they do. The wait is the harbor's own reading of
 * the seat as well as this screen's (see DraftView.picked), which is what
 * carries it across a reconnect: a captain whose tab went dark mid step
 * comes back to the wait the harbor has been keeping for them, rather than
 * to cards whose press the harbor would refuse.

// same way Market.tsx and Orders.tsx are, rather than for bartering, which
// is the activity half this screen shares with a chat composer and not the
// seat the room waits on.
//
// The screen wears two stations rather than one stack ten sections deep:
// the exchange, the two votes, the fleet's ledger and the three markets
// all open at once would put the markets under the fold at a middling
// window and make the phase read as a wall. It is the same shape
// Market.tsx uses and for the reasons written there: the station is local
// state rather than a phase value or a saved field, so a captain who
// switches stations has told the room nothing, and the wait a ready vote
// opened does not split again.
//
// What is traded splits; what belongs to the whole table does not. The
// Harbormaster's console, the two votes and the fleet's ledger draw under
// the strip on both stations, because a vote a captain cannot see is a
// vote they cannot cast, and because the ledger is where the table argues
// about what each seat passed on. Those three are one fold, below the
// console and above the board, led open while a vote is live and
// collapsed to one row otherwise. The strip itself draws only when a
// market is switched on, so a Classic harbor opens exactly the exchange
// it always had, with no second station to visit and no business fold at
// all.

/**
 * The swap: which module aboard the newly drafted one replaces. Every
 * fitted module is offered, and the captain may also step back to the
 * picker without spending the choice.
 *
 * [F7: the power budget] Each row reads its own slot's arithmetic: the
 * new module landing where that one sat, so replacing a heavy module can
 * be allowed while replacing a light one is not, and the disabled rows
 * say why before the click (the engine refuses the same picks as the
 * floor under this). The roll's filter promised the card fits over the
 * heaviest module on the hull, so at least one row here always fits.
 *
 * The harbor's bar is drawn under the header for the reason the draft's is:
 * this screen is a seat the ready check waits on, and the captain standing
 * in it is the one who should be able to see the table waiting.

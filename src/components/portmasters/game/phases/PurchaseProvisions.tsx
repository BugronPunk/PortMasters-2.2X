/**
 * Provisions. The Larder, the three foods, and the rations that fill it.
 *
 * The crew is the artisan roster, and this is where it eats. The panel sits
 * on the market board rather than in a corner of its own because a ration
 * is bought like anything else here, and it sits above the cards rather
 * than under them so the cost of feeding the crew is read before the purse
 * goes into goods: a captain who fills the hold and only then finds they
 * cannot feed the people who will work it was ordered into that mistake by
 * the screen rather than by a decision they made.
 *
 * It buys in legs, and a leg is the whole unit: the same one the crew eats
 * one of at each Dawn, and the same one this phase is. Asking for a leg the
 * stores have no room for or the purse cannot cover buys as much of it as
 * it can rather than refusing outright (see provisionFood), so the buttons
 * below describe what is about to happen instead of gating on it. The one
 * case that is refused is a purchase that would come to nothing, and that
 * is written on the button rather than left as a click with no answer.
 *
 * [C4: three foods, spoilage and the split hold] One row per food, and the
 * row is the whole decision the sea added: a meal costs the same whichever
 * food it is (see FOODS in ./constants), so what a captain is choosing
 * between is space and time, and the row prints both. The keeping figure
 * on a row that is aboard is read from the oldest lot of that food rather
 * than from a constant, because that is what the pantry will actually do
 * at the next Dusk. Preserving sits under the rows rather than beside them
 * because it is the one move that spends food to buy time, and it is
 * offered only when there is a whole batch of produce to spend.
 *
 * The three rows and the preserve move sit inside one fold, because they
 * are one decision read four ways and the fold's own gist still points a
 * captain at the preserve the moment a batch is ready. The fold sits under
 * the hunger warning rather than above it, so a hungry crew's alarm is
 * never behind a click: what the fold hides is the buying, not the state,
 * and the header above both carries the larder count and the price of a
 * leg that the buying is about.
 *
 * The hold's two halves are printed only when the split is on (see
 * holdCapacityOn), because they are the split: with it off there is one
 * unbounded pool for goods and the Larder's own meal ceiling for food, and
 * the header line reads exactly as it read before this feature, which is
 * the shape every part of the survival layer keeps when its switch is off.
 *
 * [E1: the Supply Barge] One row at the foot of the panel is not a port
 * counter at all: the anonymous vendor the plan builds as the fallback for
 * a table that never took the Quartermaster. It is drawn here rather than
 * on a board of its own because it is the same decision one rung worse,
 * and a captain should meet it while looking at the prices it is worse
 * than. Everything on the row is read from the voyage's own numbers and
 * from the constants, and what a press would buy is held to the same three
 * ceilings the sale applies, so the row describes what is about to happen
 * exactly as the food rows above it do.
 *
 * Runs only when the layer is on. With the switch off the panel is not
 * drawn at all, the larder is not read and no button is offered, which is
 * the base game.

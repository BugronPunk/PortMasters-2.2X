// =====================================================================
// [B3: standing orders] The form a captain writes once.
//
// The record it edits and the evaluation that reads it are both engine
// side (src/lib/game/standing.ts and src/lib/game/engine/standing.ts),
// so this file holds no rule of its own: every control here sets one
// field of the record, and the record is committed through the caller's
// own act() the moment it changes, which is what keeps the screen and
// the voyage from ever disagreeing. There is no Save button for the
// reason there is nothing to save: what the captain sees is already what
// the engine will read.
//
// Two consequences of that are worth naming, because both are visible.
// A change lands on a voyage that is already sailing, so a captain can
// write an order in the Market and watch it work in the same phase. And
// an unsaved edit cannot exist, so closing the dialog is not a decision.

// captain who is not holding an alignment, which is every captain in
// every Classic harbor, is never sent an entry and so is never shown
// this panel.
//
// Four things can be on it and only the first is on every card: the role,
// the personal goal the majority of the table carries, the one other
// Pirate a pair of them is told about, and how far a Broker has got. The
// second and third are printed from what the server sent rather than
// worked out here, so a card cannot disagree with the one in the drawer.
//
// The win condition is drawn here rather than sent, from the same two
// things the rest of the card is already printing: the rule that reads
// them is victoryLine, and it is the same function the server's own
// evaluation runs, so the sentence and the rule cannot drift apart.

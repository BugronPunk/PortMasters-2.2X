// The picker both of the harbor's votes draw: the list of captains a name
// may be put to, and the press that puts it. The audit and the maroon ask
// the same two questions of a captain (which seat, and is your own name
// already in), so the two cards draw one control rather than two that
// drift. Each card hands in its own verbs (the select's label, the press
// with no seat chosen, the press with a seat chosen) and keeps the rest of
// its own telling: its sentence, its refusal block, its tally and its next
// step.
//
// The list is drawn through the one predicate the server refuses on (see
// writtenOff in @/lib/seatMarks): a captain the voyage has written off is
// never offered as a name, because an option that quietly does nothing is
// worse than no option. The press reads which of the two moments the
// captain is standing in rather than the state of the list: a name already
// in reads a button that says so instead of one that offers the press a
// second time.
//
// The seat this vote is aimed at is held by the caller with the leg it was
// chosen in (see the pick state on each card), so the picker takes the
// target it should show and hands back every change rather than keeping a
// choice of its own that a phase change would have to clear.

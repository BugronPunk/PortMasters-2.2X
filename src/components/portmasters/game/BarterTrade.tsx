// =====================================================================
// The trade surface that both a chat and the Parley board use.
//
// There are two places a captain can compose a swap now: the Parley
// panel, and the composer on either chat. The rules for what makes
// an offer legal cannot be allowed to differ between them, so they live
// once, in useOfferDraft, and each surface only supplies the markup
// around them.
//
// OfferCard is the same idea for reading an open offer. The board draws
// it as a row of the board, a chat draws it as a bubble in the
// conversation; the goods, the direct offer badge, and the accept or
// withdraw action are identical between the two and are written once.
//
// Both of these act on the shared board through useBarter, which is the
// only client side copy of what is still open. Nothing here decides when
// escrow comes back: a post the room refuses is the room's to answer, and
// a withdrawal is the room's to confirm, and useBarter is what turns
// either one into the return of the goods, so there is exactly one route
// by which goods come back to a hold.

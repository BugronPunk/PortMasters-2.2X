/**
 * One mode's round, drawn as the flow it is.
 *
 * Every leg stands on the rail in the order the engine walks them,
 * wearing the fill of the phase it is, and the leg a captain is reading
 * opens the line underneath: what that leg decides for the legs after it.
 *
 * The rail is deliberately complete rather than a stepper that shows one
 * leg at a time. This panel is read before the voyage begins, to work out
 * what the mode is asking for, and a shape that has to be walked one
 * click at a time cannot be taken in at a glance or held in the head
 * while a decision is made. What the click buys is the consequence line,
 * and the reading is meant to move back and forth along the rail rather
 * than once down it.
 *
 * Every leg's body is always shown, and only the consequence line is the
 * one the focus picks. Hiding a leg's body behind a click would leave the
 * chart unreadable to a captain who never clicks, and this is the panel
 * they meet before they know what the mode is.
 *
 * Nothing here decides what a round is: the legs arrive from the mode
 * record, and the smoke suite holds them to the lap. See RoundLeg.

                  tile, so the rail is centred on it by being centred in
                  its own column, with no offset arithmetic to rot.

                  The button carries no vertical padding for the same
                  reason. The padding lives on the words instead, so the
                  tile column spans the whole row and the rail is free to
                  run from one tile to the next rather than from one
                  padded box to the next, which is what left the line
                  floating short of both tiles when the two were measured

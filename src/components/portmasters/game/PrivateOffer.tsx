// =====================================================================
// The private offer both selling boards post with: a fee, and who it is
// for.
//
// The escort market and the refit bench sell different things under the
// same terms. Both name a price in Gold, both let the seller open the
// offer to the whole harbor or shut it to one captain, both draw the same
// row doing it, and both explain the shut offer with the same sentence.
// That sentence is the one that matters: a captain who names somebody has
// to be told that the naming is what makes it private, and told it the
// same way on both boards, because it is the same mechanic.
//
// So the row is here, and the two boards keep what is theirs: what is
// being sold, the picker that chooses it, the button that posts it, the
// price they start at, and the sentence that says when an untaken offer
// dies. The last of those is a prop rather than a copy because the two
// windows really are different (a Parley, a Market) and the sentence
// around it is the same.
//
// The named offer note is drawn here too. It cannot live at the call
// sites, because it has to be told what was named and that is this
// component's own state to read.

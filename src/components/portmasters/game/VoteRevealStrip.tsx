//
// The audit's finding and the maroon's result are the same shape on
// screen: the vote's name, the leg it was made in, the captain it names,
// and a cross to put it away. The two strips were written out twice, and
// a strip is what the harbor reads for the rest of the voyage once a vote
// has landed, so two copies of it are two ways to read one finding.
//
// The frame is here and the body is handed in, because the two votes
// reveal different things: one opens a manifest and the other puts a
// captain ashore, and neither of those is a frame.
//
// The frame wears the meaning colour of the vote that made it: the
// audit's is the colour of what somebody knows, the maroon's is the
// colour of money out at its worst.

// The two votes share one shape: a heading in the meaning colour of what
// the vote costs, and the body of whichever state its window is in. Both
// votes live inside the one Harbor Business fold, so the fold owns the
// disclosure and the shell owns the heading and the section rhythm. The
// heading wears the same uppercase label the reveal strips wear, because
// the card and the strip are the same vote read at two moments.
//
// The label itself is the panel label (see PanelLabel), in caps and as a
// heading, because this is the one place on these screens where a label
// is the heading of a block rather than the name of a panel.

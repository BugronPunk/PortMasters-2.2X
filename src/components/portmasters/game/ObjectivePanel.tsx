// The voyage's public objective, in a Gambit harbor.
//
// This is the surface that answers what the whole table owes: the
// commission, from the first phase through the last, because it is owed
// by the whole harbor and a fact the whole harbor shares does not belong
// in one captain's column. Which mode the harbor runs is a fact about
// the harbor, written on the harbor's card before entry and worn by the
// boards themselves, so this strip does not say it beside its own title:
// the title is what a captain needs here.
//
// It wears gold, and gold specifically. The commission is an imperial
// one, so it wears the colour the Imperial Mandate already wears on the
// orders board, and it shares that card's classes rather than its own so
// the two read as the same kind of object. It is not a widget in the
// palette's table and takes no hue of its own: gold is a meaning token,
// not a rung on the ladder, which is why a full width surface can wear it
// without disturbing the distance between anything else on screen.
//
// It carries no standing rule text: the sentence about who pays and when
// the commission is read sits on the Deliver button, where it is wanted
// the moment it applies, and in the Guide, where every rule lives. An
// always visible paragraph of rules on a strip this one was a row of
// vinyl lettering on a working deck.
//
// Nothing here renders in Classic. There is no objective to draw there, so
// the hook returns null and this returns null with it.

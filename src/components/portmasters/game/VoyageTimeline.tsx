/**
 * The phase strip of the rail: the steps of the leg, with the one the
 * room is standing on lit.
 *
 * The phases cycle, and where they cycle TO is not written here. The
 * order is the room's mode (see src/lib/game/mode.ts), the same lap the
 * ready check and the engine walk, because the two modes run these same
 * phases in a different order. A copy of the order kept here instead
 * would be invisible in the one place it matters: a captain mid round
 * on the experimental leg would see the rail point at the phase they
 * had already finished while nothing in the engine was wrong, only the
 * picture of it.
 *
 * How far the voyage has run is written once, on the pinned VoyageHeader
 * above this strip, as a ring and a number, so the strip itself draws
 * the steps alone.
 *
 * The names and glyphs come from the phase's own face rather than from a
 * table here ([B1]: one face per phase, so the rail, the dispatcher and
 * a mode's briefing chart cannot disagree about what a phase is called
 * or drawn as). What is left here is the drawing.
 *
 * Personal sub states (module_draft, module_swap) and terminals
 * (bankruptcy, endgame) are folded into their parent step for the
 * timeline display, since they never become room checkpoints.

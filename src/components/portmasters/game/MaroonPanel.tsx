// =====================================================================
// [H7: Maroon and the Harbormaster] The harbor's heavier vote, and the
// hand it leaves behind.
//
// Four surfaces in one file, for the reason the audit's two are in one:
// they are one interaction read at four moments. The card is the vote
// while the room still has it. The strip is what the room carries
// afterwards, for the rest of the voyage. The shift strip is what the
// table trades against, while it is in force and while it is only a call.
// The console is what the captain it named does with the legs they have
// left, and it is the only surface here that one captain sees and the
// rest do not.
//
// It wears `alarm`, which is the palette's meaning for money out at its
// worst (see palette.css, where the token is described as the colour of a
// cost, a loss, an error, a bankruptcy, a raid). The audit wears `intel`
// because it reports what somebody knows; this one takes a ship, and
// dressing the two in the same blue would say they cost the same.

// The one fold this game wears: a row that names what it holds, the one
// line that says what that is, and the chevron for the rest. It began as
// VoteCardShell's closed half and was promoted to its own file the day
// two more surfaces wanted the same row (see Purchase.tsx's readings and
// Welcome.tsx's briefing), because three copies of one disclosure is
// three places to fix a chevron. The caller keeps the state, since the
// three callers mean three different things by open.
//
// The tone is named for its meaning rather than its colour, the way the
// cards themselves name it: the audit wears intel because it reports what
// somebody knows, the maroon wears alarm because it takes a ship, and the
// briefing wears harbor because it is what the pier hands a captain
// before sail. The table is module scope rather than an export: the tone
// is a parameter of this row, so every caller names it on the fold it
// draws and nobody needs the table itself.

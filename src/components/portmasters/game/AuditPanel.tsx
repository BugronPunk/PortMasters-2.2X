// The Manifest Audit's two surfaces: the card below is where a harbor
// decides to look, and the strip is what it found.
//
// The card lives inside the Parley phase, because that is the only place
// the vote can be called: the audit's price is the rest of that round's
// trading, so the button that spends it belongs on the board it spends.
// The strip is full width under the commission, because the finding is
// the whole harbor's and outlives the round it was made in.
//
// The frame both are drawn on belongs to the harbor rather than to the
// audit: the vote card (see VoteCard) and the strip a carried vote
// leaves (see VoteRevealStrip) are the ones the maroon wears too, since
// the two votes ask the harbor the same question in the same shape. What
// is left in this file is the audit's own: which window the vote opens
// in, and what it says when it does.
//
// It wears `intel`, which is a meaning colour rather than a panel's own
// hue (see scripts/palette.ts). That is deliberate and it is the same
// choice the commission made with gold: a surface that reports what
// somebody knows is not chrome, and giving it a widget hue would put a
// thirteenth colour on a wheel that already has twelve.

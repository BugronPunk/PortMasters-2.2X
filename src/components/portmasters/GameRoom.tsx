              one place while everything beside them moves.

              The head names the rail the way the roster and the chat name
              themselves, and it holds the chevron that folds the rail to a
              stub on the wide layout (see use-panel-prefs). What this
              captain sails as is the first line of the readings, below the
              head and above the voyage header, because an identity is not
              a panel a captain scrolls to: it dresses everything below it,
              and its stage is the table's board rather than the captain's
              own rail. The chip draws nothing at all in a harbor with the

                    The peer ledger is the one thing a card shows that the

                    voyage, on the captain's own screen, and no drawer holds

          {/* Right: roster + chat, last of the three columns at every width.
              The chat belongs beside the roster rather than at the foot of
              the page, where it would sit three screens down on a narrow
              window and read as missing. The FleetTicker above already
              carries the roster at these widths, so the pair can follow the
              stage rather than opening with it.

              On a wide window this is the column a captain scrolls least and
              reads most, so it holds still: the roster and the chat split
              the column's height two to three, and the split is a ratio
              rather than a pair of sizes, so it holds at every window. A
              fixed cap on the roster's share is not a share: a 320px cap
              would pull the pair to 34/66 at one window and 32/68 at
              another, and two panels closely related enough to be balanced
              should be balanced the same way at every height. Each panel
              still scrolls inside itself, and if
              the two together need more room than the column has, the column
              scrolls rather than either panel being cut off at the knee.

              Below the breakpoint the pair stacks, and each panel stands
              on a height of its own: a share of the viewport, clamped so a
              short phone still shows a list rather than a sliver and a
              tall one is not mostly chat. Flat heights would be
              comfortable on one window and crowding on the next, which is
              why the wide layout's two floors under the split are viewport
              relative for the same reason: they keep a short window from
              squeezing either panel past reading height, and what counts
              as reading height scales with the window too.

              Either panel folds to a strip of its own on the wide layout
              (see oneFolded above): the open one takes the rail's width,
              the folded one stands beside it at the outer edge, and the
              rail is fully used however many panels are open. Below the
              breakpoint the fold is instead a fold to the panel's own
              head, because a full width row has no width to give up; the
              chevron on that head is the way back there. Folding both
              folds the rail itself (see rightFolded above): the column
              gives way to one stub holding the two icons, one press each,
              so the way in names the panel it leads to. */}

/**
 * Live roster of room members, collapsed down to what matters at a glance:
 * gold, reputation, and whether they're still in the run. Click a row to
 * open the full detail popup (cargo, workers, log) in PlayerDetailModal.tsx.
 *
 * [MANIFEST: Partial Sight] Each non self row carries an eye button that
 * opens a small popover showing a banded cargo read of the target captain.
 * The bands come straight from bandFor in engine/partialSight: "none", "a
 * few", "some", "plenty", "a haul". The peek is gated by canSeeDetail, so
 * only a captain at or above the viewer threshold looking at one at or
 * above the subject threshold sees the button at all. The cargo snapshot
 * is fetched on demand via usePlayerDetail's requestDetail and banded
 * client side, never as raw numbers.

/**
 * The three Houses wear the colours they are named for: a pavilion of
 * jade, a gate of vermilion, a crown of lotus gold. The palette carries
 * one token each, and everything that draws a House reads from here, so
 * a House is never one colour in one panel and another colour in the
 * next.
 *
 * This lives apart from the components because two of them draw a House:
 * one list with two readers, so a House wears the same colour in the
 * Great Houses dialog and on the leaderboard.
 *
 * The maps are typed to the Houses themselves, so a House that the
 * engine knows and the palette does not is a compile error rather than a
 * House that quietly wears the fallback everywhere it is drawn. The token
 * each House wears is the House's own fact (see HOUSE_TOKENS in the
 * engine), so the three forms below are built from it rather than each
 * spelling the colour out: a House added there is a House the crest, the
 * tint and the bar all know how to draw.

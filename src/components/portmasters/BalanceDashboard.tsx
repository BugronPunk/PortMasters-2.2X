// =====================================================================
// The balance dashboard: one page that answers whether the mode is
// healthy.
//
// [I3: the dashboard, and the front page number] The plan asks for a page
// somebody on balance duty can read in under a minute, and names the three
// questions it has to answer: is the Quartermaster seat healthy, is
// anything becoming a staple, and is the variance too swingy. The
// arithmetic is not here. src/lib/game/dashboard.ts reduces the window
// into a reading, the route behind /api/admin/balance fetches the window,
// and this file prints what it was handed without deciding anything of its
// own. That is what keeps the page and the command line report from ever
// disagreeing about a number: both ask the same reader, and neither
// recomputes what the reader already said.
//
// The front page is the strip at the top: the plan's front page number,
// the Barge revenue share, and then the three questions, each with the
// state it is in and the one line it can answer with. The panels below are
// the same three questions in detail plus the floor, and every row on them
// carries the gate it is judged against and the verdict, so a reader never
// has to hold a target in their head to know whether a number is good.
//
// [I4: the launch gates, and the three hundred voyage run] Above that strip
// sits the ship decision: the sixteen launch gates reduced by
// src/lib/game/gates.ts into one of three states, with the reasons behind
// it. The verdict is computed here rather than fetched, from the reading
// this page already holds, so the strip costs no second query and cannot
// be reading a different window than the panels below it.
//
// Read only, over REST, once on arrival and whenever Refresh is pressed.
// Nothing on this page subscribes to anything, so leaving it open cannot
// matter to a voyage that is under way.

/**
 * Voyage Difficulty Advisor. Suggests which difficulty tier to pick
 * based on the captain's Renown level, past voyage count, best score,
 * and solvent streak. The advisor is advisory only, the captain can
 * still pick any tier.
 *
 * Three bands, read from the top down, and the first one a captain clears
 * is the advice. Monsoon asks for Renown 8, 10 voyages, a best score of
 * 200, and a solvent streak of 3. Open Waters asks for Renown 5, 5
 * voyages, and a best score of 100. Anything below that is pointed at Fair
 * Winds. The bands were described here as four once, with numbers that two
 * of the three branches did not check.
 *
 * The cautions run the other way. They fire when the tier the captain has
 * picked asks for more than they have brought, and each names the bar it
 * is asking them to clear.

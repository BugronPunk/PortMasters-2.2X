// =====================================================================
// One card, two doors.
//
// The harbor asks every captain for a name and a password, and the
// operator console asks for the same two plus the setup code. The two
// screens dress differently (a different logo, a different gradient, a
// different sentence underneath) but the form itself is one form: two
// tabs, a field per tab, the same disabled rule, the same error box, the
// same submit trip. This file is that form, written once, and the two
// screens above it are configurations of it.
//
// What stays out here: the trip itself. The card never learns which
// endpoint it is talking to, because the harbor signs in through
// api.login and the console signs in through api.login and then checks
// the role. That check is a fact about the console rather than about the
// form, so it rides in on the submit the call site hands over.
//
// The fields are declared rather than drawn, one list per tab, which is
// what lets the two doors differ in the middle of the form (the console
// asks for the setup code first, the harbor asks for a display name
// between the name and the password) without either of them owning a
// copy of the layout.

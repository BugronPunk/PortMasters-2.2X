/**
 * How to Play guide. A standalone, difficulty agnostic introduction to
 * the game's loop, accessible from the Lobby so a new captain can learn
 * the rules before ever setting sail.
 *
 * The original game has tutorialSteps and guideText locked behind the
 * game room (they need a difficulty to render the tuned numbers). This
 * component is a higher level, visual first read that covers the shape
 * of a voyage without requiring a room.
 *
 * It takes the mode rather than assuming one, because it is the first
 * manual a captain opens and the lobby is where they choose between the
 * modes: a manual that answered every question with the founding voyage's
 * rules was teaching half the harbor the wrong game before they set sail.
 * What it says about a mode comes out of the record, so the page a
 * captain reads here and the pages they read in the room cannot disagree.

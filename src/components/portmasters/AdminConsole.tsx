// =====================================================================
// The operator console: every account in the harbor, and the five things
// an operator can do to one, or to any number of them at once.
//
// The roster is whatever the server last sent. Nothing here is applied
// optimistically: an action is a request, and the answer to a successful
// one is the whole roster as it stands afterwards, so the table can never
// show a change the database did not make. A refusal leaves the table as
// it was and prints the reason above it.
//
// Ticking rows turns the register into a selection, and a selection takes
// four of the five actions a single row takes: ban, unban, grant the
// administrator role, and delete. Revoking is the one left out, because
// taking the console away from several operators at once is how a fleet
// ends up with nobody at the wheel, and it is the one action here whose
// undo is a second promotion.
//
// Every button on this screen is a convenience over a check the server
// makes again anyway, which is why the guards the console draws are only
// the obvious ones: an operator cannot point an action at their own
// account, and each deletion confirmation has to have been typed into
// before it will fire, by name for one account and by count for several.
//
// A selection is allowed to hold accounts an action does not apply to,
// because the register is a list of what exists rather than a list of what
// would work. Those accounts are skipped one by one and the reasons are
// printed, so an operator who ticks twelve and sees eleven changes knows
// which account was left and why.
//
// The register is drawn twice, from one set of rows: a table where the
// column is wide enough for one, and a card per account where it is not.
// The width that decides is the column's own rather than the window's,
// which is the whole reason for the split. A table is the right shape
// for a register this dense and a card is the right shape for a hand,
// and a table dragged sideways to reach its own row buttons hides the
// name of the account being acted on, so the screen keeps both shapes
// rather than picking one and dragging it everywhere.
//
// Three things shape the screen as it stands now.
//
// Nothing on the page carries a width of its own. The column runs the
// full width of the window with gutters that grow with it, and every
// column in the table is sized by what it holds: the tick box and the row
// actions hug their content, the name takes whatever is left over, and
// the counts sit against the right edge of theirs. A wall display spends
// its width on the register rather than on its margins, a laptop gets the
// same table at the same proportions, and a phone gets the cards.
//
// At lg and up the page is a fixed shell rather than a document: the
// header, the tools and the register's frame all stand still and only the
// register scrolls inside its frame, so an operator a thousand rows deep
// can still see the title, the search and the way out. The shell is the
// room's own shape (see GameRoom). Below lg nothing is pinned and the
// document scrolls, which is what a hand expects, and the unpinned card
// list is drawn there anyway.
//
// And a register is something an operator looks things up in, so it takes
// a search box and four counted filters: all, online, admins and bans.
// Both are views over the roster this screen already holds, decided on
// the client, and the search is deferred so a keystroke never waits on
// nine hundred rows. The selection follows the same rule: the header box
// ticks what the filters leave visible, while the actions answer for
// everything ticked anywhere in the register.

// The width at which the register has room to be a table, and the reason
// it is 52rem rather than a round number out of the scale: the table below
// is sized by its own content, and against this roster its floor, the
// narrowest it can get before a cell's text starts to break, measures 817
// pixels with the cells' padding counted. The glass frame adds its two
// pixels of border, so a container needs 819 to draw the table without a
// drag, and 52rem is 832. The number is a measurement rather than a taste:
// the six column table this screen first drew measured 881 and set the
// threshold at 56rem, and the loudest part of it was the row actions, five
// chip buttons with icons and words that alone held the widest column on
// the register. Drawing those actions as quiet words took the floor down
// to 817 and the threshold down with it, which is what let the table into
// widths the chips never fit. The width probe measures it again at every
// pass: it draws the table at each size and reads the drag to the last
// column, which must be zero. Below the threshold the register is a card
// per account, which is the right shape for the widths the table cannot
// take.
//
// The variant is spelled out at both call sites rather than held in a
// constant, because Tailwind reads class names as text and a name assembled
// from a variable is a name it never emits. The two are exact complements
// (the table asks for the width, the cards ask for everything under it) so
// an edit to one is an edit to the other: the table wrapper is
// `hidden @min-[52rem]:flex` and the card list is `@min-[52rem]:hidden`.

              a state of the register below it and not a third panel. The
              buttons keep their chips: four actions for a moment's work

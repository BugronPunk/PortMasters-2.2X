// The board of harbors already open, one row a harbor.
//
// The lobby's browse view is three things stacked: the two ways in, this
// board, and nothing else. This is the middle of those, lifted out because
// a row is where most of the lobby's small decisions live: which pills a
// harbor has earned the right to wear, who is hosting it, whether it can
// still be entered at all.
//
// The board reads its own rows and decides nothing above them. Whether a
// captain is allowed in is roomLockedFor's answer and not this file's, and
// the row shows what it was told: a harbor that has set sail renders
// Locked because the question came back true, not because of anything here
// about the harbor's state.

// The waters scale: how hard the voyage a harbor is opened at runs.
//
// Difficulty is a position rather than a choice between two things, and
// the tiers say so themselves: they run 8, 12 and 16 rounds, and the raid
// chance climbs with them. So Waters is one continuous rail whose fill
// deepens toward the storm end, with a stop per tier. It is the ladder
// half of the pair whose reasoning, including why neither control wears
// pm-pressable, is written at the top of ./VoyageCards.
//
// Every stop carries its own round count. The dial only ever showed that
// number for the tier already selected, which hid the plainest evidence
// that the three are a ladder rather than three unrelated settings.

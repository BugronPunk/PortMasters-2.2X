// =====================================================================
// The voyage cards: which of the two voyages a harbor is opened as.
//
// Voyage and Waters are different kinds of question, so they are drawn as
// two different instruments rather than as one dial used twice.
//
// Mode is a choice between two whole voyages that differ in what the
// phases are and what order they run in, so it is drawn as a pair of
// cards a captain reads one at a time. Difficulty is the other half of
// that pair, a position on a ladder rather than a choice between two
// things, and it is drawn as the scale in ./WatersScale. Drawn as one
// dial each, both became rows of identical pills, which made the larger
// choice look the same size as the smaller one and left two of those rows
// stacked on the form.
//
// Neither control takes pm-pressable. Its hover lift scales a control by
// 1.04, which suits a 2rem tool in the masthead and not a card half a
// panel wide, where the growth would reach past its own gap and onto its
// neighbour. They take the focus ring the Button primitive uses instead.

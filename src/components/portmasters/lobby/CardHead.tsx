// A card's head: one icon, one title, and whatever controls belong to
// that card on the right. The icon takes its colour from the call site,
// because colour is how a card says which part of the harbor it is.
//
// It exists so every heading in the lobby is written once: a heading grown
// by hand nudges to fit its own card and drifts out of line the moment the
// text beside it changes length, and a heading written once cannot drift
// away from itself. The figures that sit under those headings are the same
// argument, and live in ./HarborGauge.
//
// No second line of explanation sits under the title, and no prop sits
// here unread for one: no card wants a subtitle, so there is none.

// The lobby's rail: who is about, and the conversation with whoever the
// captain picked from that list.
//
// Two panels, not one that swaps between them. Merging the pair gave the
// conversation the whole rail, which took the roster away whenever a
// thread was open, and it left a captain arriving at the lobby looking at
// a list of names with nothing under it and no way to tell a chat was
// there at all. The chat keeps a panel of its own, where it can be read
// before anyone has been picked.
//
// Below the lg breakpoint this rail leads and the harbor board follows
// it, the way the game room's chat column leads. Stacked last, the
// conversation sat under the whole board, and its depth grew with every
// harbor the fleet had open, so it read as absent rather than as simply
// further down. The board is one short scroll away instead, and a captain
// scrolling a room list is reading anyway. Above the breakpoint nothing
// moves.
//
// It reads the roster and the thread and decides nothing of its own:
// every piece of state it draws is the lobby's, handed in as props.

// =====================================================================
// The card in front of the operator console.
//
// Two ways in, and they are not symmetrical. Registration asks for the
// setup code from ADMIN_SETUP_CODE and creates an operator account;
// signing in is the ordinary captain sign in, followed by a check that the
// account it produced is actually an operator.
//
// Neither check is the lock. Every admin event is authorised again on the
// server, against the account row, at the moment it is asked for; this
// screen exists so that somebody who is not an operator is told so
// plainly rather than being shown a console whose every button refuses
// them.
//
// The form itself is CredentialCard's, shared with the captain's door.
// What is this screen's own is the setup code (a field the harbor never
// asks for), the role check behind the sign in tab, and the console's
// colors.
//
// Its notice is why an operator is looking at this card again rather
// than at the console they had open: the role was taken away, usually by
// another operator. The page owns it, because the page is where the
// refusal was heard.

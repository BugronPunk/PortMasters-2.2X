/**
 * One header for the three panels that fold: the captain's rail, the
 * harbor roster and the chat. They answer one question between them,
 * what is this panel and is it open, so the anatomy is shared here: an
 * icon, an uppercase name, an optional note about the panel's own state,
 * and the chevron that folds it.
 *
 * `collapsed` is the panel's own state rather than this header's, because
 * the fold lives in one record (see usePanelPrefs) that two surfaces
 * read: this chevron and the rail stub a rail level fold leaves behind.
 * `meta` is that record's mirror image, a reading about the panel (the
 * roster's headcount) rather than a control, which is why it sits with
 * the name and the chevron sits after it.
 *
 * `railLevel` marks the folds that only exist on the wide layout: a rail
 * collapses to a stub beside the stage, and below the breakpoint there is
 * no stub to come back from, so the chevron is not drawn there.

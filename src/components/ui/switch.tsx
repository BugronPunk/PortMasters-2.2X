// The one on and off control in the app, in the two sizes it is drawn at.
//
// The small one is the house switch (see the lobby and the standing
// orders), and the wide one is the settings screen's. The wide one is
// wide because the settings rows are read at a glance and the control
// beside them has to be as easy to hit as the row is to read.
//
// They are one control because they are one control: a switch that looks
// one way in the lobby and another way in the settings is two things to
// learn, and the house rule about one meaning per shape applies to
// controls as much as to words. The size is a prop, so the behaviour, the
// keyboard handling and the focus treatment are one implementation.
//
// The wide thumb's travel is the travel the setting's own control had:
// an eighth of a rem from the near end when the control is off, and the
// same eighth from the far end when it is on. The track and the thumb
// are both sized in rems, so the gaps are rems too, and the thumb lands
// in the same place at any text size.

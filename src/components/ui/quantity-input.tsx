/**
 * A numeric field that can actually be typed into.
 *
 * A quantity field that parses and clamps on each keystroke:
 *
 *   onChange={(e) => setAmount(Math.max(1, parseInt(e.target.value, 10) || 1))}
 *
 * has three separate defects from one line. Deleting the last
 * character yields "", `parseInt("")` is NaN, and `NaN || 1` restores 1 before
 * the replacement can be typed, so "delete the 1 and type 4" is impossible.
 * Where a ceiling was also applied, typing a digit above the amount held was
 * truncated immediately, putting any larger multi digit target out of reach.
 * Together those left select all and overwrite as the only workable gesture.
 *
 * So this holds a raw string draft while focused, permitting the empty field
 * and any intermediate value, and only parses, floors and clamps on commit
 * (blur, or Enter). Callers still receive a valid number and never see the
 * draft. Submission paths validate independently anyway (callBrokersFavor
 * rejects an out of range ask), so committing late is safe rather than the
 * only guard.
 *
 * type="text" with inputMode="numeric" rather than type="number": it keeps the
 * value fully under our control, avoids the browser spinner reintroducing its
 * own coercion, and still raises the numeric keypad on touch devices, which is
 * what the tablet reports needed.
 *
 * The previous value and the editing flag are stored as state (not refs) so
 * the draft can be adjusted during render via the React documented pattern
 * for "reset state when a prop changes" (see
 * https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#resetting-state-when-a-prop-changes).
 * That keeps the field from yanking itself out from under someone mid edit
 * without either a setState in effect (cascading renders) or a ref read in
 * render (forbidden by the react-hooks/refs rule).

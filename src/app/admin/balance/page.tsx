// /admin/balance: the balance dashboard.
//
// [I3: the dashboard, and the front page number] Its own route under
// /admin rather than a tab on the console, because it belongs to a
// different job: the console is about accounts, and this is about whether
// the mode itself is healthy. Somebody on balance duty opens this page,
// reads it, and leaves, and nothing they do here can touch a voyage that
// is under way, because the page only ever reads.
//
// The account is checked once on arrival and the dashboard is only shown
// to an operator, but as on the console that check is convenience rather
// than the lock: the reading is authorised again on the server, against
// the account row, at the moment it is asked for.
//
// Unlike the console there is no sign out here, and no socket. The page
// holds no session of its own: the Console link leads back to /admin,
// which is where an operator's session is opened and ended, and the
// reading itself travels over REST on the cookie the browser already
// holds.

// GET /api/admin/balance: the balance dashboard's reading.
//
// The first read the operator surface has on REST, and it is read only in
// the strongest sense: it opens two tables that hold finished voyage
// facts, reduces them, and writes nothing. Nothing here reads a room, a
// seat, a save or a socket, so the page it feeds cannot slow a voyage
// down, which is the plan's rollback for goal I3 as a property of the
// code rather than a promise in a document. The window itself lives in
// src/server/telemetry-window.ts, which the launch gate report reads as
// well, so the page and the report answer for one set of voyages.
//
// The gate is the account row, checked here at the moment the reading is
// asked for, the same way every socket admin action checks it: the page's
// own check is a convenience that keeps a captain from being shown a
// dashboard, and this is the lock.

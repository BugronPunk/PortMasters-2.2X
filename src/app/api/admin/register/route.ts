// This is the one operator action that lives on REST rather than on the
// socket, and it is here for exactly one reason: it has to set a session
// cookie. It reads no live state and changes none, so the copy of the
// realtime layer inside this bundle never comes into it. Everything an
// operator does afterwards rides the socket, where the live maps are.
//
// The gate is ADMIN_SETUP_CODE. verifySetupCode fails closed, so a
// deployment that never set one cannot be registered into at all.

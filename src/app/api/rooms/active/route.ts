// GET /api/rooms/active: the harbor the current captain is still seated in,
// if any, so a page load can put them back where they actually are.
//
// Why this exists. Harbor membership is durable (the RoomMember table) and
// is already the authority the realtime layer trusts: the checkpoint
// required roster is built straight from it. The client, however, held
// the active harbor in React state only, so any reload dropped a captain
// into the Lobby while the server still counted them as seated and still
// waited on their ready vote. Reading membership back from the database
// rather than persisting a room id on the client keeps one source of
// truth. A captain who deliberately leaves has no membership row, so
// they correctly land in the Lobby; a captain who merely refreshed does,
// so they land back aboard.
//
// This returns the harbor only, deliberately without chat history, even
// though GET /api/rooms/[id] bundles both: GameRoom refetches detail and
// recent messages itself the moment it mounts, so shipping them here too
// would put up to a hundred rows on every single page load for a caller
// that throws them away.

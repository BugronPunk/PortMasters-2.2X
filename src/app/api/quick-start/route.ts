// This route deliberately does not enqueue anybody. The queue is a Map in
// the realtime layer's memory, and a route handler runs in the Next.js
// bundle, so it would be looking at a different copy of that module with a
// different and permanently empty queue. The browser does the real work
// over the socket, by emitting `quickstart:join`, and waits for
// `quickstart:matched` (or `quickstart:error`) in reply.
//
// What this route is good for is the one thing the socket cannot do well:
// turning an expired session into a plain 401 the caller can react to
// before opening a socket at all.

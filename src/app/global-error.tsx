// that loads the game's stylesheet. That is why every rule below is an
// inline style rather than a class: a class would be a name with no
// stylesheet behind it, and this screen would render as unstyled text at
// the exact moment the game is least able to explain itself.
//
// It carries the same words as the screen-level boundary beside it, so
// the two failures read as one game handling one kind of problem, and
// its only action is a reload, because at this level there is no segment
// left to re-render.

// It replaces the root layout, so it sits outside the providers as well:
// the language read below is the fallback reading, which answers in the
// language the process already holds and has no tree above it to redraw.

// documents, names the service's own address in its variable (the same
// one next.config.ts reads for the development origin), so a deployment
// resolves its real address with nothing to configure.

// masthead can never disagree about what this build is called. The authors
// field stays undeclared: it would name a studio that does not exist, and
// nothing in the app reads it. The social fields carry the card built
// beside this file, which is why the two of them are named here rather
// than described twice.

// The sentence a search engine reads (the description) and the two words
// beside it are read in the captain's language, which is why this is a
// function rather than a constant: metadata is built per request, from
// the same cookie the socket's handshake reads, and the English a captain
// sees today is what the read answers back when the cookie says English
// or says nothing. The line itself is the pack's frame with the build's
// own name filled in, because the name is a name and never translates.
//
// The link preview and the social card carry the sentence WITHOUT the
// name, which is the plain APP_DESCRIPTION they have always carried; the
// pack carries only the named spelling (shell.001), so those two fields
// keep the shipped constant unwired rather than gaining a prefix their

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the draft and the switch of papers.
//
// The draft, as one captain sees it, and the
// one change of papers a voyage allows.
//
// The steps are a union and a list of the same four, so a reader that has to
// ask whether a string off the wire is one of them asks in one place. The view
// is addressed to one captain because a hand is that captain's own, and the
// switch is harbor wide by design rather than by plumbing.
// =====================================================================

import type { PathId } from "@/lib/game/paths";

// The draft, as one captain sees it.
//
// This is the one frame in the tree that is private in its whole shape
// rather than in a field, and that is the design's own reason for the
// feature being dealt by the server at all: "a hand of cards is private
// information and the client cannot be trusted to deal it." So the view is
// addressed to one captain through emitToUser and never broadcast: the
// hand below is that captain's own, and no frame that reaches a harbor
// carries a card nobody has played yet. The private scan holds the
// delivery rather than this comment (rule seven of
// scripts/private-scan.ts), and the suite holds the shape from the other
// end: the draft's pass in scripts/smoke/ keeps every frame the two
// sockets at its table receive, on every event rather than on the three
// the feature names, and reads them for a hand that is not the one that
// seat was dealt.
//
// The step is the draft's beat and nothing else. Three steps, three keeps,
// and each one turns over when every seat has answered rather than when a
// clock runs out: the harbor waits for its captains, and there is no
// countdown on any surface for a client to render or to disagree about.
// A seat whose connection has gone is laid its first card by the harbor's
// own absence watch, which is timing nothing anyone is shown (see the
// server half in src/server/realtime/draft).
//
// `open` is how many captains at the table have still to choose this step,
// which is a count and never a card, so it is safe to put in front of the
// table and it is what makes the wait legible: a captain knows whether
// they are waiting on four people or on one.
//
// `picked` is whether this reader's own card is down, which the count
// cannot say and the reader's screen needs: a captain whose tab went dark
// mid step comes back to a hand the harbor has already laid a card from (see
// the absence watch in src/server/realtime/draft), and the view has to be
// what tells them, because the screen that does not know offers the cards
// again and then refuses the press. It is the reader's own answer and never
// a card, so it tells the table nothing `open` does not already.
//
// `path` is the whole of the result and is null until the draft is done.
// A finished view is sent once more to every seat when the last step
// closes, which is how a client that reloaded mid draft, or one that never
// answered at all, still learns what it sails on: the path rides the
// view rather than a frame of its own.

// The four steps as a list, for the reason VOYAGE_LOG_KINDS is one (see
// voyage-log.ts): a step arrives off the wire as a string, so the client
// that reads a view has to ask whether the string it was handed is one of
// these, and a reader that asked by writing the four out again in its own
// file would be a second answer to that question. Written out rather than
// derived from the type for the same reason: a step added to the union
// above and forgotten here is a step the client drops on the floor, and
// this list is where that would show.

// The one change of papers a voyage allows,
// as the harbor is told about it.
//
// This one is harbor wide, unlike the draft's own frame, and the difference
// is the design rather than the plumbing: the design's clause for switching
// is "the switch is published to the fleet log where everyone sees it...
// the price of changing your identity is that everyone knows." So the same
// fact travels twice, deliberately: the log line is the record the fleet
// reads back at Dusk, and this frame is the harbor watching it happen.
//
// The switching captain's own client applies the change off this frame
// rather than off its own press (see pathSwitchBlocked and
// applyPathSwitch), which is what makes the harbor's answer the authority:
// a switch the server refused is a switch that cost nobody anything.
//
// It carries the path taken up and not the one set aside, for the reason
// the log line does: the server has never read a captain's save, so a
// "from" here would be the harbor repeating a claim it cannot check.

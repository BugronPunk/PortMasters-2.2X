// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Manifest Audit.
//
// The Manifest Audit, which is neither of the two above.
//
// The private entry is a secret defended to the wire and the commission
// is a number nobody needs defending from. This is a third thing: one
// captain's own business, opened to the whole harbor by a vote of the
// harbor. It is therefore the one broadcast in the protocol that names a
// captain, and the only reason that is safe is what it is allowed to name
// them for. The reveal is built out of the manifest record (see OrderFill
// in @/lib/game/types) and the shape below is the whole of it, so the
// same property that protects the private channel protects this one from
// the other side: there is nowhere in these three payloads to put an
// alignment, a hold, a purse or a card, so no version of a reveal can
// leak one. The smoke suite reads every frame the harbor receives back and
// checks that, rather than trusting the types.
//
// The vote and its running tally are public by design. A nomination is
// made out loud, like a ready check: the harbor is meant to see who is
// accusing whom, because the argument that follows is the feature. What
// is not public is the manifest itself, which only the carried reveal
// carries, and only for the one captain the majority named.

 * The three numbers beside the names are the harbor's own count, and they

 * and the member list a client holds is a different set, since a captain
 * who has gone bankrupt keeps their seat at the table and their name in
 * the roster the client reads while dropping out of this count. A card
 * left to subtract one from the other would print a threshold that
 * disagreed with the server, so the server states it. All three are
 * public for the reason the names are: none of them says anything about
 * a manifest or about who is lying, only about who has spoken so far.

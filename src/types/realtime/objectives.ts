// The fleet commission, and the deliberate contrast with the block above.
//
// The objective is public: everyone in the harbor owes the same commission
// and everyone can see how much of it has been handed over. So this shape
// is the one place in the mode that is meant to be broadcast to the whole
// room, and it carries two fields for the same reason the private entry
// carries a typed role: a payload with nowhere to put a secret cannot leak
// one. There is no captain id in either direction. A report says what one
// captain handed over and nothing about who they are, and the total the
// room receives is a sum that names nobody.
// =====================================================================

/**
 * [I1: the telemetry spine] What one captain reports about a leg they
 * played: the orders it dealt them, the ones they filled, and the number
 * of different goods their hold closed it carrying.
 *
 * The actor is deliberately not a field. The captain sending this is the
 * captain it is about, and the server reads them off the socket rather
 * than off the payload, so a report cannot be filed against somebody
 * else. `leg` is the client's own, because only the client knows which
 * leg it was playing; the server bounds it against the voyage before
 * recording anything.
 *
 * [C4: three foods, spoilage and the split hold] The four optional fields
 * are the captain's own reading of the hold they closed the leg with: how
 * many slots of the ship were carrying something, and how many meals of
 * each food were aboard. They are optional on the wire rather than
 * defaulted, because they mean something only under the switches that
 * create them: the slots belong to the split hold, the meal counts to the
 * survival layer, and a leg sailed without those carrying a zero would be
 * a report of an empty ship rather than of an unmeasured one. The server
 * keeps a field it can read, drops one it cannot, and bounds both (see
 * the telemetry:leg handler).

  // client sends (see noteCharterTaken). The report keeps no copy of it.
  // The server validates the id against the pool, attaches the path and

  // them, and drops the take it cannot attribute on both, so this field

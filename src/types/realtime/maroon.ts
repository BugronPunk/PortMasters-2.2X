// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the harbor's second vote and the Harbormaster.
//
// The harbor's second vote, and the one
// action in the protocol by which a captain moves another captain's books.
//
// Laid out like the audit block above, and for the same reason: the vote
// and its running tally are public because the argument that follows is
// the feature, and the result is public because it is a thing the harbor
// did out loud to a captain standing at its table. Nothing private lives
// in any of these payloads and there is nowhere in them to put anything
// private. The result names a captain and a round; the shift names a port
// and a direction.
//
// The shift is the one worth describing. It is a client's action whose
// effect lands on other clients' books, since every captain in the harbor
// prices their own market against it, so it travels the road the Harbor
// Pulse already travels rather than a second road built beside it: the
// server holds it for the round, broadcasts the notice below, and includes
// the bare shift on the advance that opens a port market (see
// maybeAdvance in src/server/realtime/checkpoint.ts). Nothing prices a
// market off the notice. The notice is what the harbor reads.

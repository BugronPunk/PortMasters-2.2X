// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the mute list and the report row.
//
// [J2: the mute and the report] The moderation surface on the wire.
//
// Two shapes, one each way. The roster frame carries the mute list, and
// the answer to a report travels back to the captain who filed it.
//
// The roster frame is declared here rather than typed inline at each of
// its readers, because the meaning of one of its fields narrowed and a
// narrowed meaning that lives in three places is a meaning that will drift
// back: mutedUserIds is what THIS recipient may see, not the harbor's list.
// The server builds the shape, so annotating the payload there is what
// holds it to this declaration, and both client readers take the type from
// here rather than restating it.

// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the private channel.
//
// The private channel.
//
// One entry, addressed to one captain, delivered on `private:entry` to
// that captain's sockets and to nobody else. Everything hidden in this
// game travels this way and nothing hidden travels any other way: no
// broadcast payload carries a secret, which is a rule the realtime layer
// holds rather than a habit, and the smoke test asserts it by keeping
// every frame every socket in a harbor receives and reading them back.
//
// An entry is a line for a captain's own log rather than a state change,
// which is why it carries its own text: the server writes the line, and
// the interface prints what it was sent rather than assembling the same
// sentence out of fields on this side of the wire.
//
// role is the one field in the whole protocol that can name an alignment.
// It is optional because most entries will not have one, and it is typed
// rather than a string so that a second place to put an alignment would
// not compile.
// =====================================================================

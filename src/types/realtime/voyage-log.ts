// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the harbor's log.
//
// The harbor's log.
//
// The public half of the pair above, and the contrast is the point: the
// private channel is addressed to one captain and to nobody else, and a
// line below goes to every socket in the harbor. Nothing here may carry a
// hidden thing, which is why an entry's only field beyond its kind is the
// sentence the server wrote: whatever is printed in a line is public the
// moment it is sent, so there is no shape here for a secret to travel in.
//
// The text travels with the entry for the same reason the private entry's
// does. The server writes the line and the surface prints what it was
// sent rather than assembling the sentence out of fields on this side of
// the wire, so one line cannot read two ways on two screens.

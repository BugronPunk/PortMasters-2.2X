// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the fleet's ledger of boon picks.
//
// [F5: public offers] The plan's feature is one sentence: every offer is
// public, the whole fleet sees the three cards you were shown and the one
// you kept. This module is the server half of it. One record per captain
// per room, replaced by the next pick, broadcast to the whole room after
// every accepted report.
//
// There is no switch here, and that is the plan's rollback clause read as
// code: "This is the one build layer feature that must not be quietly
// disabled, because the hidden role mode's evidence surface depends on
// it. If it is turned off, the mode's mode flag goes off with it." So the
// gate is the harbor's own mode record and nothing else, the same shape
// the audit's rung follows (see auditOpensAt in @/lib/game/mode), except
// that the ledger has no rung: boons are drafted from the first leg, so
// the mode is the whole of the question. A Classic harbor never records a
// report and never receives a frame, because nothing ever emits one to it.
//
// The map is a room's for the voyage and is cleared the way the audit's
// is: on a restart and when a room is deleted, beside clearAudits (see
// the clear block in ./index). A joiner is handed the ledger directly
// (see the handoff in ./wiring/room-join), exactly as a joiner is handed
// the audit's reveal, because public state a reload can miss is state the
// table has to say again.
//
// Nothing here trusts a report's shape: the fields are read and bounded
// in ./wiring/boons before this module is ever reached, and what arrives
// here is already a BoonRecord off the public catalogue. What this module
// still judges is order: a report from an older leg than the record the
// captain already has is refused rather than stored, so a stale tab
// cannot rewind the table's picture of a captain who has since picked.

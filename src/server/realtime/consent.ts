// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the board a consent market is held on.
//
// [D4: Loom: the Refit] A board is harbor state, because an agreement between
// two captains is an object no single client can be the authority over, and
// the harbor keeps it while the two clients each apply their own side of it to
// their own state. D3 wrote that module for the escort contract and D4's
// refit needs the same one, so what D3 wrote is here once, as a factory, and
// ./contracts and ./refits are two bindings of it.
//
// What a binding supplies is the two things that differ between kinds: the
// event a board broadcasts on and the shape of the payload it broadcasts,
// which include the one place the two kinds' visibility rules part company
// (see visibleContracts in @/lib/game/engine/contracts, which reads the
// shared filter and then drops the one field only an escort carries). What
// the factory supplies is everything else, and it is the whole of the
// board's life: writing it back, personalizing every send, dropping a
// departed captain's rows, sweeping a moved checkpoint, and the silent wipe
// a torn down harbor gets.
//
// The two trust boundaries every consent board holds are worth restating
// here, because they are decisions rather than omissions and they are now
// held by two features instead of one.
//
// The server does not know who holds a path, and it does not ask. A path
// lives in a captain's own save, beside their hold and their purse, and the
// server has never read one: this is the same line the barter board draws
// when it says posting and accepting are validated against each captain's
// local state and the server "still doesn't know what's in anyone's
// inventory". What the server can enforce it does enforce, and everything
// else about a post is a captain's own claim about themselves.
//
// The server does not price a term, and it does not clamp one either. What
// a raid would have taken from a covered captain is that captain's own
// report, and what the guns ate is worked out on the seller's client against
// the seller's own purse; the points a refit puts back are worked out on the
// customer's client against the customer's own wardrobe. There is no number
// here that this module could check either against, and the bounds that
// matter are the ones both captains already agreed to. What the server does
// is keep a row honest about its ordering: one term per agreement, only
// against a row that was agreed, only from the captain whose name is on it,
// and only in the leg it was sold for.
//
// Transient by the plan's own instruction: "Contracts are transient harbor
// state rather than durable, so this rolls back cleanly." Nothing here is
// written down, and a save never carries an agreement. It carries the tally
// of what already settled and the ledger of movements already applied, both
// of which are records of the past rather than live agreements.

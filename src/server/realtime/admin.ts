// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the operator console.
//
// Everything an operator can do to an account runs here, on the socket,
// and the reason is structural rather than stylistic. A route handler
// runs inside the Next.js bundle and gets a different copy of the
// realtime layer, which owns its own maps (see the note on
// tearDownIfRoomGone in index.ts). An account flagged from a route would
// be flagged only in the database: the socket layer would still hold the
// captain as authed, still seated, still playing a live voyage, because
// requireAuth trusts what the connection established and never asks the
// database again.
//
// So the console speaks the socket, and every handler here reads the
// acting account's row before it does anything. That read is what makes a
// revoked operator lose the console on their next click rather than on
// their next reconnect.
//
// The one piece that does not belong here is registration, which has to
// set a session cookie and so stays a route (/api/admin/register).
//
// A ban and a purge share three steps: sessions deleted, seats reaped on
// the spot through the same reapDeparture the grace timer uses, sockets
// detached and closed. They differ in what is left behind. A ban keeps
// the row, so the account can be let back in and its harbors, if other
// captains were sitting in them, carry on. A purge deletes the row, and
// the cascade takes every harbor that account hosted with it, which is
// why those harbors' other captains are told and returned to the Lobby
// before the delete happens.

// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the telemetry spine's accumulator.
//
// The pure half of the spine is src/lib/game/telemetry.ts, which owns the
// event vocabulary and the shape of a record. This is the half that
// touches the world: it decides whether a voyage is recorded at all, it
// holds the events for one voyage in memory while that voyage runs, and
// it writes the record once, when the voyage stops.
//
// Three rules shape every function below.
//
// It never blocks a voyage. Nothing here awaits before it appends, nothing
// here throws into a socket handler, and the one database write happens at
// the end and is logged rather than thrown if it fails. A harbor that
// cannot record itself must still be able to sail.
//
// It is opened by a departure and closed by an ending. A voyage that
// concludes, a voyage the host wipes and a harbor that empties all leave
// a record, which is what the plan means by a broken voyage producing a
// record that explains where it stopped. The outcome is the record's own
// word for which of the three happened.
//
// It samples per voyage, not per event, and the draw is deterministic off
// the voyage's own identity. One number decides whether a table is
// recorded, every event from that table follows the decision, and a
// decision that had to be reproducible is reproducible: the same seed
// gives the same answer on a reload, on another process, and in a test.

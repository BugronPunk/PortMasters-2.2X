// Realtime layer: harbor chat, direct messages, muting, and the roster
// frame.
//
// emitRoomMembers reads the harbor's current host fresh from the database
// every time rather than cached, since host changes are rare and this
// only fires on join/leave/disconnect, never on the hot game action
// path. mutedUserIds rides along on the roster frame every captain
// already listens to, so muting someone needs no separate client
// subscription, and the field survived that frame changing from a harbor
// broadcast to one delivery per captain without one: what changed is who
// the frame is addressed to, not what a client subscribes to (see
// emitRoomMembers).
//
// [MANIFEST 14: Harbor Watch] Who the host has muted from harbor chat
// this voyage, in memory only. Cleared at departure, on room:restart and
// on harbor deletion, alongside every other per voyage structure: a mute is
// a judgement about a table, so a new table starts with none.
//
// A conversation held inside a voyage is held here in memory and nowhere
// else. Both logs below are keyed by harbor and die with the harbor they
// belong to, so nothing a captain says during a session outlives the
// session. That is the whole point of them. The Message table remains,
// but it now only ever holds the two things said outside a voyage: the
// public harbor square and direct messages between captains in the lobby,
// where there is no harbor to belong to and the thread is expected to still
// be there tomorrow.
//
// The entry bound is a memory guard rather than a retention policy. A
// voyage that outgrows it loses its oldest lines, which is the same
// trade the REST history routes already made.

// never told would only find out by talking into a harbor that cannot hear

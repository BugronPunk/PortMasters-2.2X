// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the Harbor Pulse tallies.
//
// [MANIFEST 01] Every client already knows what it bought this round;
// this just adds up everyone's reports so the next round's market can
// lean toward or away from whatever the harbor actually did, instead of
// every captain's price roll staying completely blind to the rest of
// the harbor.
//
// Keyed by harbor, then by round, since a report can arrive for the round
// that's just ending while a slower captain is still mid report for the
// one before it. Reports for a round are only ever read once, the moment
// the harbor advances into the next round's Market (see maybeAdvance in
// checkpoint.ts), and are never written to the database: losing this on
// a server restart just means one round rolls with a neutral market,
// which is the same as round 1 every voyage already looks like.

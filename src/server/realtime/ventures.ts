// Persisted through the ConvoyVenture Prisma model rather
// than kept in memory like the barter and aid boards: a venture can sit
// open across many rounds, not one phase, so losing it to a server
// restart would erase real Gold every contributor already put in.
// Scoped by (roomId, voyageEpoch), never just roomId, so a host
// restart's fresh epoch can never resolve, or even see, a venture from
// a voyage that no longer exists.
//
// One filled venture per voyage, harbor wide: once any venture in a
// harbor's current voyage has ever reached filled, nothing else can.
// hasRoomClaimedVenture is the one check both venture:post and
// venture:contribute run before doing anything else.

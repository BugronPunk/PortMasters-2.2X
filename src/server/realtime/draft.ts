// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the path draft, and the book of switches.
//
// [D7: the draft, and switching] The room's half of the plan's clause. The
// rule it deals by is pure and lives in src/lib/game/draft.ts; what is here
// is the part that cannot be pure, which is why it is here rather than
// there: a hand of cards is private information and the client cannot be
// trusted to deal it. So the deck is built and shuffled in this process,
// the pass is resolved in this process, and a captain is sent their own
// hand and nobody else's, through the same emitToUser the private channel
// uses. No frame that reaches a room carries a card nobody has played yet.
//
// Where the draft sits in the voyage is a seat of its own [W2], and it is
// stated here because the seat did not always exist. The deal still happens
// on the departure, in the same breath as the alignment deal, but the room
// now stops there: a dealing Gambit lap carries the draft's seat between
// the pier and Dawn (see checkpointPhaseOrder in src/lib/game/mode.ts), the
// server pins the room to it at departure (see ./wiring/start-voyage), and
// the round's first leg phase opens only once every seat holds a path. The
// step off the seat is this module's own announcement rather than a ready
// vote, because the departure is the settle: settleDraft tells the
// checkpoint to move the room (see announceDraftComplete in ./checkpoint),
// and every captain's client runs that step the same way it runs any
// announced one. The engine reads a path live off the save
// (pathCargoModifier, lockedBehind), so everything the path does begins
// the moment the save holds it, which is the moment the settled view is
// read.
//
// Nothing in the feature is a countdown, and nothing shows anyone a timer.
// The steps close when every seat has answered, and a captain who is still
// connected holds the table however long they take: the room waits for its
// captains, not for a clock. The one clock left is the absence watch below,
// which exists for the seat that is gone rather than slow. When a seat's
// last socket drops, the room gives it DRAFT_WATCH_MS to come back and then
// lays the first card of that captain's own hand for them (the same
// DRAFT_AUTO_PICK the old auto keep used), because a table held forever for
// a captain who is gone is a voyage that never sails.
//
// The book of switches is the module's other half. It is the room's own
// record of who has changed their papers this voyage, which is the half of
// that rule the server can enforce: the fee, the forfeiture and the once a
// voyage stamp all live in the captain's own save, but a publication that
// anyone could ask for twice is a fleet log nobody can trust, so the book
// is kept where the frames are written. It is a Map rather than a table
// for the plan's own reason: "draft state is transient per voyage, so
// nothing durable is at risk."
//
// [F6: charters at leg four] The module keeps a second book beside the
// switches: who is sailing on what. The draft's own seats carry each
// captain's path while the draft runs, but the seats are dropped the
// moment it settles, and the charter take filed at leg four needs the path
// long after that, so the settled paths move into a map of their own (see
// pathsByRoom and heldPathOf). A switch moves that map with it, and both
// endings drop it, which is the switches' own lifetime above and the same
// reason: the captain's save is the durable copy of their papers, and the
// room's copy of either fact lasts exactly one voyage.

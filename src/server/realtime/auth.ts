 * names some other captain's harbor is not answered at all rather than
 * answered against the caller's own. That last part is the one worth
 * having in a single place, since a handler that forgot it would not look
 * broken, it would look like a captain reading a room they are not in.
 *
 * The room is returned as a plain string rather than the nullable one on

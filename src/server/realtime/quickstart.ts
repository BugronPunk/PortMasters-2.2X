// Realtime layer: Quick Start queue.
//
// [MANIFEST 16] A captain who just wants to play, without rounding up
// a room code or waiting for a friend, joins the Quick Start queue.
// matchQueuedCaptains pairs them into an existing open public room that
// hasn't set sail yet (the first one with a free seat), or creates a
// fresh one if no such room exists. The matched captains receive
// quickstart:matched with the roomId and roomCode, and their client
// joins the room exactly as if they'd typed the code in by hand.
//
// The queue is a plain in process Map: no horizontal scaling, so that's
// all the durability it needs. A captain who disconnects while queued
// is removed on disconnect (see the handler in wiring/disconnect.ts).

// before either has created anything. Each would find no open harbor, each
// would open its own room, and the two captains would be seated in
// different harbors, which is the opposite of being paired. Chaining makes

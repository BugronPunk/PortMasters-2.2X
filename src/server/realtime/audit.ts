// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the Manifest Audit's vote, and the reveal it carries.
//
// The vote is the first majority in this game. Everything else a room
// decides, it decides unanimously: a phase advances when every captain
// active has said ready, and a captain who does not want to move simply
// does not. The audit is the deliberate exception, because evidence the
// one captain under suspicion can veto is not evidence, and the plan asks
// for a simple majority of the table.
//
// So the rules below are all about what a majority is allowed to do. It
// may open one manifest, once a voyage, from the fifth leg, during the
// Parley checkpoint, and only for a captain the room still counts. It may
// not do it twice, and it may not do it to a bankrupt captain, who has
// nothing left to hide and is already out of the room's calculations
// (see activeRosterSet, the roster the maroon vote is also counted
// against; the advance's own ready check waits on the narrower roster in
// that same module, and the two are deliberately distinct).
//
// It is also the second thing in the mode whose reveal is transient state
// the clients cannot rebuild, and it heals the same way the commission
// does: the reveal lives on this map for the voyage, and a captain who
// joins or reloads into a harbor that has already audited somebody is
// handed it directly (see the room:join handoff in ./wiring/room-join),
// exactly as a joiner is handed the commission's board.
//
// Nothing about the phase belongs in here. The audit consumes the leg's
// Parley phase, but it does that by telling the room what it found, and
// every client then leaves the phase the way it always leaves one: by
// marking ready. A server that shoved the roster into the checkpoint's
// ready set instead would advance the checkpoint while every client sat
// waiting to be told, which is the one way to leave a room stuck forever.

 * One accepted nomination, carried as far as it goes: the count the room is

 * this call and a captain can leave the harbor in the gap. What the two
 * reads buy is in the two branches below, and both of them are about a
 * carry being either fully recorded or cleanly abandoned.
 *
 * A carry that cannot be recorded is not abandoned to nowhere. The reveal
 * is read out of the target's own membership row, so a target who leaves
 * the room between the carry being decided and the manifest being opened
 * leaves the reveal with no name to print. Returning there would mean the
 * room had been shown the tally that carried the vote and nothing else
 * ever happened, which is a vote that visibly carried and left no record
 * of itself. The loop derives it again instead: the departed captain's
 * nominations come out of the book, the carry is decided again on what is
 * left, and the room is told whenever the count it is reading moves. The
 * loop turns at most once per nomination dropped, so it cannot spin.
 *
 * A carry cannot be recorded twice either. Two ballots that arrive in the
 * same tick can both read a book that holds both of them, so both can
 * decide the same carry and both go on to read the same reveal; the second
 * to resume finds the room already answered and stops there, so one carry
 * is one record, one log line and one frame. That check is after the await
 * rather than before it, which is the half of the fix the door cannot
 * make: the door has no wait in it, and this one does.
 *
 * The tally goes out once for an accepted nomination and once more
 * wherever a later pass finds the count moved under it. Both are the same
 * frame built by the same builder, so a room can only ever read a count
 * the server would stand behind.
 *
 * The maroon's own settle is this walk's mirror rather than a call into
 * it (see src/server/realtime/maroon.ts), and everything before the commit
 * is shared rather than copied (the book derived again and the walk that
 * decides it, see pruneStaleVotes and carriedTarget above). What one
 * shared settle would have to take as parameters is everything after it:
 * this walk reads a reveal out of the target's own save, that one reads a
 * display name out of their membership row, the maroon writes a mark onto
 * the target's line and this one does not, and each makes its exactly once
 * check on its own state after an await, which is the line suites 28 and
 * 29 hold by frame count. A single function carrying all of that would put
 * that check further from the state it guards than the mirror costs.
 *
 * The first pass is always told, because it follows an accepted
 * nomination, which is always news; every pass after it is a recount a
 * refusal prompted, and those tell the room only when the book actually
 * moved under it.

 * count they are counted against, and the reveal is the manifest the room
 * voted to open. A refusal is the one case that does not tell the room
 * anything, and it is also the case where the room can be reading a count
 * that no longer holds: the room is told when the refusal's own recount
 * moved the book, and not otherwise, so a captain pressing twice cannot

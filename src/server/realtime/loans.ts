// A granted loan (see aid:help) used to vanish from this server's view
// entirely the moment it was handed over. This is the one piece of
// state that makes it visible to the rest of the harbor, so a third
// captain can back it. Unlike roomAidRequests (which clears the instant
// Settlement's phase ends), a granted loan is a real debt that can span
// the rest of the voyage, so this only ever clears on repayment or a
// fresh voyage (room:restart).
//
// The in process copy stays the read path, so every handler reads a
// loan synchronously exactly as it always did. Every mutation is also
// written through to the Loan table, and the Map is rebuilt from that
// table when the process starts (see hydrateLoans). Why persist at all,
// when the mute list and the price tallies do not: a backer's pledge
// leaves their purse the moment it is accepted. Losing a mute costs
// nothing. Losing a loan destroys Gold a captain actually paid.

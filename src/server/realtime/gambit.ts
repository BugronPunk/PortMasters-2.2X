// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the private information spine.
//
// Everything hidden in this game is dealt here and delivered here, and
// nothing outside this module reads the alignment table. Four functions:
// one deals the cards when a Gambit voyage sets sail, one hands a captain
// the card they are already holding, one clears them when the voyage is
// restarted, and one reads them back for the voyage's end, which is the
// only reader outside the table that has any business knowing.
//
// The seed is the part that matters. The engine is seeded from values the
// client already knows, which is what lets both sides simulate the same
// voyage without the server running it; a hidden alignment cannot come
// from that seed, because the captain could read it. So the seed here is
// minted on the server, handed to the draw, and dropped. The draw's
// output is what gets written down, and a row is what a reload replays
// from. Nothing client side can ask for a card that is not its own: the
// read below is by user id, and the delivery below hands the entry to
// that captain's own sockets.
//
// One thing a card carries names somebody else, and it is worth being
// exact about it. At a table that dealt two Pirates they are told each
// other, which is the design rather than a leak: the pair gets the
// comfort and the coordination problems of a team. So a Pirate's entry
// carries an ally, and that ally is a name and an id and never a role, it
// goes to the sockets of the two captains it names and to no others, and
// the smoke suite sweeps for it on every socket the way it sweeps for a
// role.

 * captain, because the conclusion walks every finisher anyway and this is
 * one indexed read of a table with one row per seat. It is called after
 * the last captain has finished, so nothing of that read is in flight
 * during play, and what it answers is written to a row only the captain
 * it belongs to can read.
 *
 * [F6: charters at leg four] The charter take is the second. The leg
 * report's one claim that is not a figure is a card a captain holds, and the
 * alignment that take is recorded with has to come off this table rather
 * than off the wire (see charter_taken in @/lib/game/telemetry), so an
 * operator measurement says what the voyage dealt a captain and never
 * what a captain said about themselves. It is called during play, once
 * per leg a claim arrives on, which the once per voyage dedup in
 * noteCharterTaken bounds to what a client's repetition costs, and a
 * captain this table cannot name is left unattributed by the caller
 * rather than filled in.
 *
 * The two readers are what keeps the classification thin, and it is
 * worth restating at the second one: every read of this table is inside
 * this file, and both callers are server side. No alignment reaches a
 * captain except through the private entry's own role, which is the line
 * the frame sweeps hold and check:private watches. Nothing here is a
 * frame.
 *
 * The flourish is resolved here rather than handed back as an id, for the
 * same reason cardsFromRows resolves it for the wire: an id from a deck
 * that has since been retuned must not reach a rule as a goal nothing can
 * print. An unresolvable id reads as a card with no goal, which is the
 * card a late arrival is handed.

// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: Word on the Docks winners.
//
// [MANIFEST 02] A spontaneous, harbor wide race layered alongside the
// scheduled Imperial Mandates. Whoever's own client is first to report
// crossing the completed orders threshold wins; this server's only job
// is deciding who was first, the same first report wins arbitration
// the barter board already uses for who gets to accept a given offer.
// One winner per harbor per voyage, so this is keyed by harbor, not by
// round, and cleared on restart.

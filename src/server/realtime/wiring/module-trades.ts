  // under it is the consent factory all three of this epic's markets are
  // made of (see ../consent), so these four handlers are the same four
  // questions the two markets before them ask, this time about a card
  // rather than a leg of cover or a garment: order the posts, move one
  // offer to agreed, let the seller take an offer back while it still is
  // one.
  //
  // Two of those four now run through the frames in ./consent-shared,
  // which is where the order the questions are asked in lives, and what
  // this file holds is the market's own answers to them. The other two
  // (the taking back, and the state a captain reads) stay here, because
  // the market's own words for them are its own.
  //
  // The money never passes through here, and neither does the module,
  // which is the part of this kind worth restating: the fee moves on the
  // two clients when the board says the two captains agreed, and the
  // module leaves the seller's hull on the seller's own client and lands
  // on the buyer's on the buyer's (see applyModuleTradeSide). No captain's
  // machine ever writes another captain's state, which is the rule every
  // cross captain movement here follows: the server brokers the agreement
  // and the owner applies it. That is also why a sale is not checked
  // against the seller's hull: this server has never read a save, so a
  // listing is a captain's own claim about their own hull, and a lie about
  // it settles as an empty hand rather than as a module out of nowhere,
  // because the remove is a find on the seller's own state.
  //
  // So what the server is authoritative about is again the ordering, and
  // for this kind that means three things. A module changes hands at the
  // Parley table and not mid leg, so the phase on the row is the Parley.
  // One module is listed once a leg by the captain selling it, which is
  // this kind's own bound and sharper than the by buyer one every market
  // shares (see moduleListedThisLeg). And a listing names a module the
  // pool knows, checked through the game layer's own reader rather than
  // trusted from the post.

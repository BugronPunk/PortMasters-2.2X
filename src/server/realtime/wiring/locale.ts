// =====================================================================
// The locale frame: the captain's language, kept current on the socket.
//
// The handshake reads it from the pm_locale cookie (../cookies), which
// covers every connection that follows a reload. This frame covers the
// one the cookie cannot: a captain who flips the pick with the tab
// still open. The server composes some captain facing lines at the send
// (tFor over SocketState.locale), so the write here is what carries a
// live flip to those lines. No authentication gate: a language is a
// taste rather than a credential, and a frame that arrives before the
// auth hold has settled writes the same field the handshake already
// filled.
//
// The write covers the room's log too, and in two steps. It lands on the
// socket's own copy of the language, which is the one the log's
// accumulator renders each frame from, so every line the room writes
// after a flip arrives in the new language. And it asks the log's
// history door for a reprint, because the lines already held on the
// captain's screen were built for the old one: the log is stored as
// facts, so the whole voyage can be read again in the language just
// picked, and the client replaces its copy wholesale rather than leaving
// a log that starts in one language and ends in another.

  // The desk's two frames, and the shape of
  // the feature shows in what this server is and is not authoritative
  // about.
  //
  // It is not authoritative about who may speak. The path a captain holds
  // lives in their own save, and this server has never read one, which is
  // the same line the barter board and both consent boards draw. So being
  // the Aroma is not checked here: what the server checks is everything
  // about the row that can be checked without reading anyone's save, which
  // is more than either of the other two markets can check about theirs.
  //
  // It is authoritative about the four things a row has to be true about
  // for the feature to work at all. A rumor is spoken at the Parley, so
  // the table hears it and so the market it moves is the next one. It is
  // spoken in a round that has a round after it, so the market it names is one
  // this voyage opens rather than a settlement that never comes. It
  // names a good the coming market actually trades, so a lean always lands
  // on a price rather than on nothing. And it respects the cooldown, which
  // is measured off the harbor's own rows rather than off a counter a client
  // could carry: the wait between two of one captain's rumors is a fact
  // about this harbor's voyage, and it is the one rule in this feature that
  // a doctored client could otherwise simply not obey.
  //
  // Where the direction travels is the last of it, and the server is what
  // makes that work: the publish broadcast and the state request both go
  // through the payload builder, which strips a standing row's direction
  // from every reader but its publisher (see publicRumors). There is no
  // frame in this feature that carries a live direction to the harbor, and
  // the delivery is held rather than trusted here: bazaar:update is the
  // private scan's eighth rule, which refuses a board that reaches a harbor
  // channel (see scripts/private-scan.ts).

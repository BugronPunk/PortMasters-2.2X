// =====================================================================
// The two frames a harbor vote answers on: a nomination, and the count.
//
// The Manifest Audit (see ./audit) and the maroon (see ./maroon) are
// the same question asked with different weights, so they are wired the
// same way. A captain names a captain, the count goes out to the whole
// table, and a refusal goes back to the captain who sent it and to
// nobody else.
//
// The two were written as two copies of that shape, and copies drift,
// because a shape written twice is a shape with two answers. The guards
// around a vote are the same rule on both sides: the harbor is the one
// the socket is seated in, the leg is the one the checkpoint is standing
// on, and the phase is the one the vote belongs to. A frame names a
// harbor, a leg and a captain, and the harbor and the leg are read from the
// server's own books rather than taken from the frame, so a doctored
// frame can ask a question but cannot widen the table that has to
// agree.
//
// What is shared here is the plumbing and nothing else. What a vote is
// allowed to do, who it counts, and what it costs a captain belong to
// the module that owns the vote, and the helper is handed that module's
// own record function rather than a copy of its rules. The four frame
// names are handed in as well, for the same reason: the audit's frames
// and the maroon's are different names, and they are the names the
// clients already listen for.
//
// The refusal is the part worth reading. A press that did not land says
// so to the captain who pressed and to nobody else, because the harbor
// is arguing about a vote and the one captain whose press did not land
// is the one who needs to read why. Nothing is broadcast, so a refused
// frame leaves the table's count exactly as it was.
//
// The maroon's third frame, the Harbormaster's call, is not one of
// these two: it is a lever rather than a vote, and it is wired by the
// module that owns it.

  // [D7: the draft, and switching] The two surfaces the plan's clause
  // gives the fleet, and they are opposite kinds of frame, which is the
  // whole design of the feature.
  //
  // A draft is private in its whole shape. The hands are dealt here, the
  // pass is resolved here, and a captain is sent their own hand and
  // nobody else's, because "a hand of cards is private information and
  // the client cannot be trusted to deal it" (see the header of ./draft,
  // which is where the deal itself lives). Nothing below broadcasts a
  // card, and no frame that reaches the room carries one.
  //
  // A switch is the opposite, and that is its price: "the switch is
  // published to the fleet log where everyone sees it... the price of
  // changing your identity is that everyone knows." So the handler below
  // refuses what the room can check about a switch, and then hands the
  // publication to the module, which writes the frame, the log line and
  // the measurement as one act.
  //
  // Neither handler writes a save. The fee, the forfeiture and the once a
  // voyage stamp are the captain's own and are applied by the captain's
  // own engine when these frames come back (see applyDraftPath and
  // applyPathSwitch), which is the line every client authoritative fact
  // in this build draws, and the reason a draft can end on a server that
  // has never read a save.

  // The hand this captain is holding, asked for by a surface that just
  // mounted. A captain who is not in a draft is answered with a null,
  // which the client reads as nothing to draw rather than as an error, so
  // this request never has to explain which of the three nulls it was.

  // cards of the same path (see keepFrom). The frame names the step it was
  // read off as well as the card, because an index is only a card against
  // one hand: an answer that crossed a step's close is refused at this door
  // rather than counted against the next step's cards (see takeDraftPick).

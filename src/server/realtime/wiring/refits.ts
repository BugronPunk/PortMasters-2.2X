  // [D4: Loom: the Refit] The bench a Loom captain sells repair work from
  // at a port. The board itself lives in ./refits and the machinery under
  // it is the consent factory both of this epic's markets are made of (see
  // ./consent), so these four handlers are the same four questions the
  // escort's are, asked about a garment instead of a leg of cover: order
  // the posts, move one offer to agreed, let the seller take an offer back
  // while it still is one.
  //
  // The money never passes through here either, and the reason is worth
  // restating for this kind, because a refit is the first trade in this
  // tree that changes what another captain owns rather than what they
  // hold. The fee moves on the two clients when the board says the two
  // captains agreed, and the points go back on the customer's garment on
  // the customer's own client, because the garment is theirs (see
  // applyRefitSide). No captain's machine ever writes another captain's
  // state, which is the rule every cross captain movement here follows:
  // the server brokers the agreement and the owner applies it.
  //
  // So what the server is authoritative about is again the ordering, and
  // for this kind that means three things. A refit is offered at a port
  // and not at sea, so the phase on the row is the Market. One Loom
  // captain takes on one refit a leg, which is what makes the offer worth
  // reading rather than a queue one pair of hands cannot work through.
  // And a bench offer names a garment that exists, checked through the
  // game layer's own reader rather than trusted from the post.

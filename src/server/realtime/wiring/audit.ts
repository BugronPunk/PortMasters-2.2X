  // and the leg is the one the vote names. Everything else the vote is
  // judged against, including the roster it needs a majority of, is
  // read in recordAuditVote from the harbor rather than from the payload,
  // so a doctored frame cannot widen a majority.

  // the client listens for, and the module that holds the rules behind

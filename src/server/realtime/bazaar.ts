// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the bazaar board.
//
// [D5: Aroma: the Bazaar Rumor] The board an Aroma captain speaks from
// during Parley. It is the third market this epic's paths hold in room
// state and it is the simplest of the three, because there is nothing to
// agree: an escort contract and a refit are both promises between two
// captains and need the consent machinery underneath them (see ./consent),
// and a rumor is one captain speaking and the room hearing it. So what
// this module keeps is a list of rows rather than a table of offers, and
// what it borrows from the other two is only the one thing all three
// share: every send is personalized, and the personalization is the
// feature rather than a courtesy.
//
// The rule being held here is that the direction a captain leaned stays
// with that captain until the market it moves has been drawn. Two captains
// in one room therefore read two different boards, so every payload is
// built for its reader (see publicRumors in @/lib/game/engine/bazaar,
// which is the rule itself) and every board a captain is ever shown has
// been through that one function.
//
// What this module deliberately does NOT do, and the reason is worth the
// lines it takes: a departing captain's rows stay on the board. The two
// consent boards drop a departed captain's rows, because a promise from
// someone who is not in the harbor is a promise nobody can settle, and
// the plan's own line is that betrayal lives in the gaps between
// contracts. A rumor is not a promise to anyone. It was published in the
// open, the harbor heard it, and the market it moves prices it whether or
// not the captain who said it is still ashore. Dropping the row when they
// leave would reprice every good for the captains still sailing, which
// is the half applied settlement the plan's rollback note warns about
// dressed as a cleanup. The row goes when the voyage does.
//
// Transient by construction: nothing here is written down, and a save
// never carries a row. What a save carries is the lean those rows made,
// which is the market's own copy of it (see bazaarLean in
// @/lib/game/types).

// Realtime layer: the maroon vote, and the Harbormaster's hand.
//
// [H7: Maroon and the Harbormaster] The second thing in this game a
// majority of the room can do to one captain, and the only one that costs
// them anything. The audit opens a manifest; this takes a ship. So the
// rules below are all about what a majority is allowed to take and when.
//
// It may be called once a voyage, from the mode's rung (nine legs, see
// ModeConfig.maroonFrom), during the Parley checkpoint, and only for a
// captain the room still counts. It may not be called against a captain
// the harbor has already written off: a bankrupt captain has lost the
// race already, and handing them the Harbormaster's power would make the
// vote a way to arm an ally rather than a way to punish one. It may not
// be called twice, and the captain it names is not removed from the room,
// which is the point of the mode rather than a mercy (see ./game/seats).
//
// The power that comes with it is the one piece of another captain's
// state a client can move, so it is held here for the leg it was called
// in and delivered by the server on the advance that opens the port
// market, exactly as the Harbor Pulse is (see maybeAdvance in
// ./checkpoint). Nothing about it is priced off the notice that goes out
// when it is called.
//
// Like the audit, this module deliberately knows nothing about phases.
// The vote costs the table nothing and closes nothing: it is called at
// the table, in front of everyone, and the leg goes on. A marooned
// captain readies up for the next checkpoint with everyone else.

 * further from the state it guards than the mirror costs. The shape of the
 * walk is the same because the race it closes is the same, and it is worth
 * saying plainly what that race is, since this is the vote that costs a
 * captain their ship:
 *
 * The book is derived again against the room that exists now, which is a
 * second read rather than the door's, so a captain who leaves the harbor
 * in the gap between the carry being decided and the result's own read of

 * the harbor having been shown the tally that carried and never having
 * been shown the result, which is the worst shape this vote can fail in: a
 * majority visibly voted a captain ashore and nothing happened. The loop
 * derives it again instead, which takes the departed captain's nominations out of
 * the book and decides the carry again on what is left, and the room is
 * told whenever the count it is reading moves. It turns at most once per
 * nomination dropped, so it cannot spin.
 *
 * The other half is the pair in the same tick: two ballots that arrive together
 * can both decide the same carry, and the second to resume finds the room
 * already answered here and stops, so one carry is one result, one mark on
 * the target's line, one log line and one frame.
 *
 * The first pass is always told, because it follows an accepted
 * nomination, which is always news; every pass after it is a recount a
 * refusal prompted, and those tell the room only when the book actually
 * moved under it.

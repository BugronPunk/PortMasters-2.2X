// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the synchronized phase/round ready check.
//
// The room's shared checkpoint: the round + phase every captain is
// expected to be at. This server never runs game rules, it only counts
// who has said ready for the checkpoint it already knows about and
// tells the room to go once everyone active has. Each client
// independently runs its own (identical, deterministic) transition
// when it gets the go, which is how they all land on the same next
// phase without this server needing to know what that phase is.
//
// checkpointRank and openingPhase are the shared helpers from
// @/lib/game/checkpoint, forwarded so this module stays the single place
// server code reads anything about a checkpoint from, and lapSuccessor
// is read here directly to find the step that opens the port market.
// All three are a boundary, not a copy: the lap they read lives with the
// mode (see @/lib/game/mode), so there is nothing here that a change to
// that lap could leave stale.
//
// [B2: hard timers, the server as timekeeper] This module also owns the
// room's clock. A phase is a segment of real time, and a table where a
// captain has closed a laptop must not be held hostage by one: every seat
// of the leg carries a budget (PHASE_FACES.seconds in @/lib/game/phases),
// the room's checkpoint holds the moment that budget runs out, and the
// expiry announces the same advance a unanimous ready set announces,
// through the same emit. Nothing here runs game rules, on the clock's path
// or on any other: the server moves the room's own seat and each client
// runs its deterministic transition, exactly as it does for a vote. The
// one difference is that a captain who has not acted commits the phase's
// defaults instead of their own choice, which is the auto commit in the
// engine's lifecycle.

//
// The report an announcement is owed.
//
// A seat moves when a client reports the seat it moved to, so an announcement
// is a promise the room has made and the reports are what keep it. Every
// client that hears the frame runs the transition it was holding and reports
// the seat it landed on, and the first report naming somewhere further along
// moves the checkpoint (see advanceCheckpointFromReport in
// ./wiring/status-heartbeat).
//
// That promise can go unpaid, and this is the half of the protocol that says
// what happens when it does. Three ways it happens in the field, and one shape
// covers all three: a report that never leaves a captain's browser (a dropped
// frame, a tab that was asleep, a connection that died between the announce
// and the answer), a departure that does not move the seat it is run from (a
// client one build out of date, or an engine seat that returns without
// handing off), and a room where every captain's client is simply slower than
// the table's patience. In all three the room holds a full ready set, every
// captain's screen says the table is ready, and nothing moves: every later
// ready vote finds the lock already taken and returns, so no amount of
// pressing ready can free it.
//
// The client's own heartbeat is the first cure and it is not enough. It
// sends a captain's status again every eight seconds, which lands a report that
// never left, and that is why the grace below is longer than one heartbeat
// rather than shorter: an honest but slow client gets its own retry in before
// the room decides anything. What the heartbeat cannot do is anything about a
// captain whose client is standing where it already was, which is exactly the
// state a dead departure leaves behind, and no client can see the room's lock
// to clear it. So the room clears its own.
//
// The deadline is not a second clock. The clock is a seat's budget, authored
// per phase and switched on per table, and its expiry is a move: it announces
// the advance itself and commits every captain who was holding nothing. This
// is the other thing entirely, an answer to an announcement the room already
// made, and what it does is hand the seat back to the table: the lock is
// cleared, the room is told, and the ready check is open again for a vote the
// captains can actually keep. Nothing about the seat's own rules is decided
// here, and a room whose report lands in time never sees any of it.

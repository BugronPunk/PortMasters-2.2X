// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the bartering offer board.
//
// The one piece of real cross player state this server owns besides
// loans and ventures. Everything else here is either a vote count or a
// relay; an open barter offer is an actual object two different
// captains' inventories need to agree happened, so unlike the rest of
// this file, this server is briefly authoritative over it. It still
// doesn't know what's in anyone's inventory or wallet though: posting
// and accepting are validated against each captain's own local state on
// their own client, this just makes sure only one captain can ever
// claim a given offer.
//
// One board, two surfaces. The Captain's Exchange at the Parley
// posts exchange offers, which are open to every captain at every
// Renown level and are never rationed. A chat composer posts flexible
// offers, which are the earned extra: gated at a Renown level, and only
// so many of one captain's own flexible offers may ever be taken. Each
// offer carries which of the two it is (see the flexible field on
// BarterOffer), and both kinds sit on the same board so a captain sees
// every swap on offer in one place whichever way it arrived.
//
// targetUserId is optional: unset for an ordinary open offer, anyone in
// the room can see and accept it. Set for a direct offer to one specific
// captain, a safeguard against exactly the failure mode an open board
// has (agreeing on a trade with someone in chat and then having a third
// captain accept it first). A direct offer is only ever visible to its
// poster and its one named target.

// ========== Flexible bartering gate ==========
// This gate stands in front of flexible bartering alone, the composer a
// chat carries. The Captain's Exchange in the Parley phase reads
// nothing here: it is open to every captain at every Renown level, and
// every branch that would have consulted a level for it is gone.
//
// Renown rides the roster as a client reported, optional number, which is
// fine for drawing a name and useless for deciding who may trade: a client
// could simply report level 21. The account row is the only authoritative
// source, so the gate reads that instead. Nothing is derived here, because
// the voyage conclusion writes the level column beside the XP it came
// from, so the two can never disagree about where the curve puts a
// captain.
//
// Returns null rather than a fallback level when the read itself fails, so
// a database hiccup is never mistaken for a captain who genuinely holds no
// Renown. A gate that fails open under load is not a gate, and a gate that
// tells somebody at level 20 that bartering "unlocks at level 10" sends
// them looking for a problem that does not exist.

// database reads and be certain the second pass saw the board the first

// language of the captain whose accept it refuses: the sentence travels
// back to that captain's socket and to nobody else.

// [H8: the reveal and the replay ledger] The end of an Ocean Gambit
// voyage is the one moment the mode's central secret stops being one. The
// cards were dealt at departure, defended all the way to the wire, and
// every rule in the mode was written so that no frame carried an
// alignment; this is the frame that carries all of them, and the only
// reason it is allowed to is that there is no voyage left to spoil. It is
// built by the conclusion, once, out of the verdicts and the readings that
// conclusion has already made, and it is emitted from here.
//
// In memory, like every other per room record in this directory, and for
// the same reason: the voyage it describes has ended, so it is read by
// captains who reload onto a finished table and by nobody during play. The
// durable record is the Chronicle row each captain already has, written in
// the same pass, so losing this map costs a reloading captain the ledger
// and never a result.

// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: voyage conclusion and Captain's Legacy.
//
// Fires once per harbor, the moment every current member has reported
// reaching either endgame or bankruptcy: the whole harbor's voyage is
// over for everyone still seated in it. Whoever reached endgame (not
// bankrupt) with the highest reported Reputation is crowned Sea Master.
//
// This is also where Reputation earned this voyage becomes Renown XP on
// every finisher's account, persisting across every future voyage they
// ever sail, unlike Gold, cargo, and ship level, which a restart wipes on
// purpose.
//
// concludedRooms guards against firing twice for the same voyage;
// room:restart clears it so a harbor that plays again can conclude, and
// be crowned, again.
//
// NEW for the manifest: records one VoyageChronicle row per finisher
// (using buildChronicle from chronicle.ts) and CaptainRival rows
// for every pair of finishers (using recordRivalOutcomes from rival.ts).
//
// [H8: the reveal and the replay ledger] And flips the cards: the whole
// hand, every verdict and the fleet's commission leg by leg go out as one
// voyage:reveal frame after the standings, in the one mode where a hand
// was dealt (see ./reveal.ts).

// =====================================================================
// Realtime layer: the fleet commission's tally.
//
// The objective is the one thing in Ocean Gambit that is public by
// design, so this is the one new thing in the mode that is meant to be
// broadcast to the whole room, and it is worth saying out loud how it
// differs from the alignment sitting next to it in this directory. The
// alignment is a secret defended all the way to the wire. This is a shared
// number nobody needs defending from, and the only two defences it gets
// are the ones a shared number needs: it cannot be double counted, and it
// cannot be inflated past what the commission asked for.
//
// In memory and never persisted, like the Harbor Pulse tallies. The
// difference is that losing these on a restart costs more than a neutral
// market, so the clients are the record: every captain holds their own
// contribution in their voyage state, and each one reports it again on a
// heartbeat, which rebuilds the whole board from nothing within seconds.
//
// Reports are cumulative totals and are merged by max rather than summed,
// which is what makes all of that safe. A reload, a reconnect, a
// duplicated emit and a report sent again after a restart all land on the same
// number, and a report that arrives out of order cannot walk the board
// backwards.
//
// The cap is applied where a report is accepted rather than where the
// board is read. What arrives is held to what the harbor has left of every
// good at that instant, and only that much of it is merged, so the fleet's
// record can never hold more than the commission named no matter how many
// captains press at once. That read, the judgement on it and the merge
// that follows are one synchronous stretch with nothing awaited inside
// them: this is a single Node process, so the second of two reports that
// arrive together is judged against the board the first one just wrote
// rather than against the board it also read. The clamp in objectiveTotalFor
// below still caps the sum it hands out, as the last line of defence a
// public number wants, but it is no longer the only one: a harbor whose
// tallies were somehow overfilled reads met rather than "17 of 12", and
// what rides the wire is what every client would have clamped for itself.
//
// Two frames reach this module and they are two ends of one press. A
// report is a captain's standing on the board, sent on a debounce and on a
// heartbeat, and the room hears a sum. A handover is the same standing
// offered by a press on the Deliver button: it is asked before the goods
// move rather than after, the accepted rows come back to that captain
// alone, and the room hears the same public board either way (see
// recordObjectiveHandover). Both go through the same acceptance, and both
// hold the room's claim while they settle, which is what makes two
// captains pressing in the same instant settle one after the other.

 * rather than what may be added to it: their standing on the board plus
 * what the harbor has left of that good, which is the same number read from

 * believed, one whose report is past it has their line raised to the
 * ceiling and no further, and a commission already filled has a ceiling of
 * nothing for everyone, which is what refuses a handover to a filled
 * commission rather than banking it and clamping it later.
 *
 * Everything the honesty of the board rests on is the same shape it was:
 * the goods the deck does not name are dropped, counts that are not whole
 * numbers are dropped, and a report below what is already merged is merged
 * by max like any other, so a report sent again, a duplicate emit and an out of
 * order frame all still land on the number already standing.

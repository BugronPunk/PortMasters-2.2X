// Realtime layer: online presence and room rosters.
//
// Two maps sit at the centre of this module:
//   sockets     socketId -> SocketState
//   userSockets userId    -> Set<socketId>   (a user may hold several)
//
// onlineUsers() collapses the sockets map down to one row per user for
// the lobby's captains online list. roomMembers(roomId) collapses it
// the same way for a single room's roster, newest socket wins so a
// reconnecting captain's fresh status overrides the stale one their
// dropped socket is still broadcasting.
//
// scheduleDeparture arms the 30s grace timer that reaps a seat after a
// captain's last socket goes away. A reconnect inside the window cancels
// it; a sustained absence lets it fire, which calls leaveRoomForUser
// and tears down every per room structure for a deleted room.
//
// scheduleBootDeparture arms the same timer for the same reason at
// process start, and differs in one respect only: a harbor that loses
// its whole crew that way is kept instead of removed.
//
// Both take their cleanup callbacks as parameters rather than importing
// them, because they sit at the top of a dependency chain that reaches
// into barter, aid, chat, conclusion, and the cross module room
// teardown. Passing them in keeps the dependency graph acyclic.

// timer for every current member of every room as soon as the process
// comes up. A captain whose browser tab is still genuinely open
// reconnects within a couple of seconds (the client authenticates again
// and resends room:join automatically), which cancels this. Anyone who
// doesn't reconnect within the window is reaped the same way.
//
// It arms the boot variant of that timer, so a harbor whose whole crew
// fails to come back is left standing rather than swept away. A restart
// is not the same event as everyone walking out: the room and the

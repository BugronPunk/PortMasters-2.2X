// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: realtime layer (Socket.IO).
//
// Mounted on the very same HTTP server as the Next.js app (see
// server.ts), so the site, the REST API and the realtime channel all
// share one origin and one port. There is no gateway in front of this
// and no second process to start.
//
// This file is the composition root. It creates the Socket.IO server,
// holds the cross module room teardown (the one list of every per room
// structure, and the callbacks a departure runs), and wires the
// connection. The frames themselves live one concern to a file under
// ./wiring, each of them a leaf nothing else imports, and this file names
// each one in the order the connection takes its shape. What is left here
// is the assembly no single feature module can do for itself, because
// this is the place that knows all of them.
//
// The endpoint keeps the library default of "/socket.io" so it can never
// shadow an application route. Cross origin access is deliberately left
// closed: every browser reaches this on the app's own origin, so nobody
// needs a CORS grant. The ping timings are generous so a captain who
// tabs away for a minute is not dropped in the middle of a voyage.

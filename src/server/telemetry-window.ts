// =====================================================================
// The operator window: the last three hundred voyages of a mode.
//
// [I4: the launch gates, and the three hundred voyage run] One query, in
// one place, so the two surfaces that read the run cannot read different
// runs. Goal I3 put the window inline in the balance route, where it was
// the only reader; goal I4 adds a command line report that has to answer
// the same question about the same voyages, and two implementations of one
// window is how a page and a report start disagreeing about whether the
// mode passed.
//
// The window's size comes from the launch floor rather than from a number
// written here, which is the property worth keeping: a window smaller than
// the floor is a window no run can ever clear, and taking the size from
// LAUNCH_MINIMUM_VOYAGES makes that a compile time impossibility rather
// than a constant somebody has to remember to move in two files.
//
// It reads and writes nothing. The two tables are the finished facts of
// concluded voyages (the telemetry spine and the chronicle), so a captain
// mid voyage cannot be slowed down by an operator opening a page, and the
// chronicle read is limited to exactly the voyages the window kept: one
// window for every number on the page, and no voyage counted twice.
//
// Server only. Nothing in the game's request path imports this module; it
// exists for the admin route and for scripts/gates.ts.

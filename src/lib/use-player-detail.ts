// thing), the question itself expires on the server's own clock, and a
// voyage that restarts takes every open question with it. The wait is
// timed for the reason the operator console's is (see use-admin.ts): a
// latch only a response can clear is a row that spins for the rest of the

// gives and is short enough that the row is still in front of the captain

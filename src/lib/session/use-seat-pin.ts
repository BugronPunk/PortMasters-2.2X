// is the second input to the public commission (see ../game/objectives.ts)
// and the only fact this hook holds that a captain cannot work out for
// themselves: membership can change mid voyage, so the size the quotas
// were scaled to has to be read from the harbor rather than counted off a
// roster.
//
// Null is a real state and not a synonym for zero: zero means the harbor has
// no voyage pinned, and nothing may be handed over against a board while
// the number that decides its quotas is unknown. A stamp from another
// harbor reads as null rather than as a value, which is also what makes a
// harbor change safe without an effect having to clear it.

// The start frame is what moves a lobby into a voyage, so the size the
// voyage was dealt to has to arrive on the same frame: the commission's
// quotas are a function of it, and a captain drawing the board from a
// count that is one departure out of date would be working a different
// commission than the one the server clamps their report against. The
// restart is the other half of the same fact, because a restarted voyage
// has no pin until the next departure writes one.
//
// A frame without a usable number reads as no pin rather than as unknown,
// which is the one direction that cannot wedge a hand shut: a client that
// hears "we have set sail" and cannot scale the commission is better off
// working the founding board than refusing to work at all.

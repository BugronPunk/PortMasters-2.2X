  // document down without React unmounting anything, and an action pressed
  // inside the debounce window goes with it (the state changed, the timer
  // is still counting, and the page is gone). pagehide fires for each of
  // those exits, and visibilitychange to hidden is the one a mobile browser
  // gives before backgrounding the tab, so the two are listened to as one
  // question with one answer. This narrows the same window for every action
  // in the session, not just the one that found it.
  //
  // The request is written out rather than read through api.saveGameState,
  // because keepalive is the whole point of this one and that helper does
  // not thread a RequestInit through. keepalive asks the browser to finish
  // the request after the document is gone, which is the job sendBeacon
  // does for a POST: the save route is a PUT, so a beacon cannot carry this
  // write. The browser caps a keepalive body (around 64 KiB), so an
  // unusually large save is dropped rather than half written, which is why
  // the handler stays best effort throughout: a captain with nothing
  // pending pays one guard read, and an exit the browser cuts off anyway
  // loses no more than it did before.

// loaded off the server, the seat pin the harbor publishes, the two
// broadcasts that tell the harbor where this captain stands, and the
// autosave that keeps their work.

  // which is the one moment this hook has no way to ask the harbor what lap it
  // is keeping. Seeding those captains Classic would put them on the wrong
  // phase order for the whole voyage, and because both laps list the same
  // number of phases, their checkpoint ranks would still compare cleanly
  // against everyone else's. They would diverge silently, which is the one
  // failure this whole design is built to make impossible.

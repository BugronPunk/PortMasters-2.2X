/**
 * The harbor's shared open offer board: a thin relay around the barter:*
 * socket events, kept separate from GameState the same way
 * usePlayerDetail is, since an open offer is real harbor wide state no
 * single client's deterministic engine can compute on its own. This hook
 * only tracks the board; the actual inventory effect (escrow on post,
 * credit and debit on a completed trade, escrow returned on a departure)
 * is the caller's job via the engine functions in
 * src/lib/game/engine.ts.
 *
 * One hook, both surfaces. The Captain's Exchange at the Parley
 * and the composer on a chat post into the same board through the same
 * call, and differ only in the `flexible` flag they carry: that flag is
 * what the server reads to decide whether the Renown gate and the
 * flexible allowance apply. Nothing in this hook enforces either one, so
 * a screen that draws both surfaces from here cannot invent a rule the
 * server does not have.
 *
 * `onFulfilled` fires once for every trade involving me, on both sides:
 * as the accepter (pay the requested item, receive the offered one) and
 * as the original poster (receive the requested item, the offered side
 * was already escrowed away when the offer was posted). The caller tells
 * the two apart by comparing `accepterId` against its own user id.
 *
 * `onRefund` fires with an offer of mine that is holding escrow which now
 * has to come back, and there is exactly one route by which that ever
 * happens: the board stops listing the offer. A withdrawal I asked for is
 * a departure the board confirms, and a sweep when the voyage moves on is
 * another, and the two are the same event to this hook. So the refund is
 * deliberately not taken at the moment of the press: a sale can win the
 * race to an offer a captain is trying to withdraw, and taking the escrow
 * back then would pay the poster twice for it, once in goods and once in
 * the price. Waiting one round trip is what keeps the refund and the
 * fulfilled payment mutually exclusive, since barter:fulfilled always
 * arrives before the update that drops the offer and marks its id
 * settled.
 *
 * Noticing rather than being told is what makes this safe to run in every
 * phase. An offer can only ever be reported here if this client saw it on
 * the board first, addressed to itself, so the report is bounded by the
 * server's own view and a stale or repeated broadcast cannot invent one.
 * The board also arrives whole on every join, which is what makes a
 * reload mid voyage come back with the right escrow ledger.
 *
 * `onPostRefused` fires with a post of mine the harbor turned away. That
 * post's offered goods are already out of my hold (the caller escrows
 * before it posts, and the engine's own post is what takes them), so this
 * is the one route by which a refusal gives them back. Without it a press
 * made as the leg turns leaves the goods off the board, out of the hold,
 * and gone for the voyage.

// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: realtime client.

// One Socket.IO connection for the whole tab, created the first time a
// signed in captain needs it and held until they sign out. The socket
// talks to the same origin that served this page, so there is no
// gateway, no second port and no cross origin handshake to negotiate.
//
// The session cookie is httpOnly, so the page cannot read it. Instead the
// sign in and register responses hand back the token once, it is held in
// memory here, and the presence hook presents it on the "auth" event.
// Memory only, never localStorage: the cookie is the real credential and
// this is just the way to carry it over the socket.

 * bench can say: the three actions a captain takes against it.
 *
 * There is no claim. A refit settles the moment it is agreed, because both
 * sides of it are known at that moment: the customer pays the price the two
 * captains named and the points go back on their own garment, on their own
 * machine (see applyRefitSide). The escort's claim exists because one half
 * of that trade, what a raid would have taken, is a number that does not
 * exist until Resolve, which is a fact about cover rather than about
 * agreements.

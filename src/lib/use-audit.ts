// =====================================================================
// The Manifest Audit, client side.
//
// Four pieces of state, three of them broadcast and every one of them
// stamped with the room it belongs to for the same reason the private log
// and the commission board are: a captain who sails straight out of one
// harbor into another must never see the last harbor's business on the
// new one's screen.
//
//   The tally is the nominations for one leg, and it is the whole frame
//   the server sent rather than the map out of it. It arrives after every
//   vote, including the one that carries, it is answered to this captain
//   when their card opens and nobody has voted yet (see the state request
//   below), and it is replaced rather than merged, because the server
//   sends the whole count every time and the whole count is the truth.
//
//   The reveal is the finding, and it is the one thing here that outlives
//   the leg it happened in. It arrives either as the vote carrying or as
//   the join handoff when a captain reloads into a harbor that has
//   already audited someone (see the room:join handler in
//   src/server/realtime/wiring/room-join.ts), and the two paths carry the
//   identical frame so nothing here has to know which one it was.
//
//   The refusal is this captain's own press coming back. It is a plain
//   string for the panel to print, and it is cleared by the panel's own
//   dismiss or by the next press: a sentence about a vote that has since
//   moved is a sentence about nothing.
//
// The local rule for whether this captain may vote is derived rather
// than asked for, because every part of it is already on this side of the
// wire: the mode, the phase, the leg and whether the audit is spent. What
// is NOT derived is the count: how many names carry the vote is the
// server's arithmetic over a roster this side cannot see, so it rides the
// tally frame (see AuditTally) and this hook hands it on as it arrived.
//
// The server applies the same rules again, and it is the server's answer
// that counts; this is only so the button is not offered where the vote
// would be thrown away, and so the one press a captain gets cannot be
// spent twice while the first is still in flight.

/**
 * App wide realtime connection + presence. The socket is a singleton; this
 * hook attaches listeners for presence/auth and returns the live socket so
 * components can subscribe to room / chat / game status events.
 *
 * `onSessionLost` is called with the reason when the server refuses this
 * connection's credentials. That happens when a session runs out with the
 * tab still open, and when an operator bans or deletes the account. The
 * caller owns the response, because it is the caller that knows how to
 * take the session down and where the reason belongs on screen.
 *
 * The callback is held in a ref so a caller passing an inline arrow does
 * not make the effect below tear its listeners down and put them back on
 * every render.

// =====================================================================
// [F5: public offers] The fleet's ledger, client side.
//
// Two directions in one hook because they are one conversation, the same
// way the audit's vote and finding are: the report that goes out is this
// captain's own record (written by the pick itself, see boonRecord in
// @/lib/game/types), and the ledger that comes back is the whole table's.
//
// The report is sent on the record's own change and not on a timer: the
// record is replaced by every pick the engine takes (a click, a standing
// order, the dawn fallback, a milestone answer), so an effect that
// watches it is watching exactly the events the plan's sentence names.
// The identity it sends under is stamped with the room as well as the
// decision, so a captain who sails from one harbor into another and
// happens to draw the same trio in the new voyage's first leg still
// reports it: the stamp that remembers the last send belongs to the
// harbor it was sent from.
//
// The ledger is stamped with the room it belongs to for the same reason
// the audit's frames are: a captain who sails straight out of one harbor
// into another must never see the last harbor's ledger on the new one's
// screen, and a restart clears it (the room tells every client, see
// "room:restarted").
//
// The emit is gated on the mode, which is the whole of the feature's
// gate: a Classic harbor runs no ledger, matches no frame, and this hook
// stays otherwise inert there. There is no switch to consult, by design
// (see the plan's rollback note read as code in ../server/realtime/
// boon-ledger.ts).

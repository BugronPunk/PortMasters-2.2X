// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the harbor's unlock table
//
// One data record per phrase, the same shape ./game/mode.ts and
// ./game/difficulty.ts use, and for the same reason: an unlock is a HARBOR
// property. A host types the phrase while charting the harbor, the room
// row remembers which code opened it, and every captain who reads that
// harbor afterwards reads the same record.
//
// Never per account, and that is a design decision rather than a
// simplification. If one player holds the phrase and another does not,
// the first question at every table becomes an administrative check, and
// the social experience has been taxed to protect a feature that costs
// nothing to give away. What the phrase buys is a moment, not a fence.
//
// The phrase is therefore not a secret in the way a password is, and the
// plan says so: it is seeded in the world, a voyage log hands it to the
// captain who earned it and the manual prints it for whoever goes
// looking. It is read here, beside the mode it opens, so the route that
// opens the door and the manual that prints the string are reading one
// table rather than two copies of it.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock, a database or a socket.
// =====================================================================
import type { GameMode } from "./game/mode";
// The harbor's line below is read at the moment it is built rather than
// stored, so the rumor a captain is handed follows the language the log
// it lands in prints in. The table above keeps its English values: a
// label is read where it is rendered (the harbor card wraps its own read)
// and the phrase is what a host types, which the normalizer below only
// accepts in one form.

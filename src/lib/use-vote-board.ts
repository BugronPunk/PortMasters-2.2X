// press in flight and about the count a card draws, and the count is the
// part both cards read (see VoteCensus in ./voteTally).
//
// What is not shared here is the part that is not the same: each channel
// carries frames of its own (the audit's finding, the maroon's result and
// the Harbormaster's call), so each hook keeps its own subscription and
// hands this board the frames it owns.

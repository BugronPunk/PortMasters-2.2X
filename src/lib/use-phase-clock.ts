// The harbor's clock, ticking where it is drawn.
//
// The clock belongs to the
// server: it arms a deadline when the harbor's checkpoint moves and
// announces the advance when that deadline passes, whether or not every
// captain has readied, so a table where somebody has walked away still
// turns. What is here is the reading of that deadline and the ticker that
// keeps it moving. The arithmetic itself is in @/lib/phase-clock, which
// reads the published numbers and nothing else.
//
// The ticker lives here rather than in the harbor's own hook, and that is
// the whole point of the file. The reading is state, because a number
// cannot change on a screen that has not been drawn, and that state used
// to sit in the hook every screen of the harbor shares: the harbor
// redrew itself once a second to move one countdown, so every board
// beneath it redrew with it, a hundred times a minute, for the length of
// a voyage. Here the ticker belongs to the panel that draws the clock, so
// the second that passes costs that panel a redraw and nothing else.

  // after a seat begins is drawn against the moment that seat's deadline
  // arrived rather than against the reading the last tick happened to
  // leave behind. Once the ticker has moved past the observation, the tick
  // is the fresher of the two and the countdown follows it.
  //
  // The later of the two rather than the tick alone, because a clock that
  // was not running has no ticks: a harbor sitting in a phase with no
  // deadline leaves the reading where the last clock left it, and a

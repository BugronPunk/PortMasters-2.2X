// Reading a JSON body, once.

// Every write route in this tree opens the same way: parse the body, refuse
// a request that is not JSON at all, then validate it against the route's
// schema and refuse that too. That is a dozen lines of which one belongs to
// the route, so it lives here and each route reads as its own shape.
//
// The second refusal carries the schema's first issue where there is one,
// which is how a route states its own message: write the sentence into the
// schema rather than branching here. The optional third argument is for the
// routes that deliberately answer with one sentence whatever was wrong,
// which is right for a sign in and wrong for a room code.

/**
 * Convoy Ventures: the shared, multi round board of open ventures: a thin
 * relay around the venture:* socket events, kept separate from GameState
 * the same way useBarter and useAid are, since an open venture is real
 * room wide state no single client's deterministic engine can compute on
 * its own. Unlike barter and aid, this one is backed by a real database
 * table server side (a venture can outlive a single phase, even a single
 * round), but the client side shape here is deliberately identical to
 * those two: a list, a post, an action, and a callback for when something
 * involving me resolves. The actual Gold effect (escrow on contribute,
 * credit on settlement) is the caller's job via the engine functions in
 * src/lib/game/engine.ts.
 *
 * `onContributed` fires once, only on the client that just contributed,
 * telling it exactly how much of its requested amount actually landed (a
 * venture can be topped up by someone else microseconds earlier, so less
 * may have been needed than was asked to give). `onSettled` fires on
 * every client in the room whenever any venture resolves, for any of the
 * three outcomes above; the caller filters the settlements list for its
 * own userId to find out whether it was involved at all.
 *
 * `locked` reflects whether this room has already used its one Convoy
 * Venture chance for the current voyage: once true, posting a new venture
 * will always be rejected, and it only ever goes back to false on a fresh
 * voyage.

 * The harbor's module market, as one captain sees it.
 *
 * The board, the per captain filtering and the report that fires when a
 * trade this captain is party to moves past the offer stage are the shared
 * relay's (see ./use-consent-board). What is left here is what only this
 * market can say: the three actions a captain takes against it.
 *
 * There is no claim, for the reason the bench's own hook gives: both sides
 * of a module trade are known the moment the two captains agree, since
 * what moves is a card and a price rather than a number that only exists
 * after a roll (see applyModuleTradeSide). A trade settles within a tick
 * of the accept, on the two captains' own machines, and this hook is what
 * carries the accept that starts it.

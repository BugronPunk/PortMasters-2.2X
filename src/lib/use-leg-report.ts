// =====================================================================
// [I1: the telemetry spine] The leg report, client side.
//
// Three of the plan's numbers exist nowhere but a captain's own screen:
// how many orders a leg dealt them, how many of those they filled, and
// how varied the hold they closed it with was. The server cannot count
// any of the three and must not try, so this hook reads them off the
// voyage state and files them as a claim against the leg they belong to.
//
// What is deliberately absent from a base game report is a hold
// utilization figure. The plan asks for one, and this tree's hold has no
// size: an order board of three is three of nothing, and a percentage
// invented for it would be a number no rule moves. It waited on the split
// hold in C4, which landed the size, and the slots below are what it
// reads now. The variety the hold carried stays, because it is the number
// the dashboard's staple question actually reads.
//
// [C4: three foods, spoilage and the split hold] The last four figures
// come off the same state and ride in the same report: the slots the ship
// is carrying something in, and the meals of each food in the larder.
// Each is sent only when the switch that gives it meaning is on, so a
// voyage played without the split hold or without the survival layer
// files a report with those fields absent rather than with zeroes, and a
// reader counting food knows whether it is looking at a survival leg. The
// slots figure is the ceiling of what is in use rather than a fraction,
// which is the reading the provisions panel prints: a slot with anything
// in it is a slot in use, and the record and the screen should not be two
// roundings of one hold.
//
// The report is a claim and is treated as one. Nothing in the game reads
// it, the server bounds its leg against the voyage before keeping it, and
// the last report for a leg is the one kept rather than the first, so a
// captain who keeps trading after their first count is not recorded as
// having stopped.
//
// One report is one debounced effect. A hold changes good by good and an
// order board empties one order at a time, so the effect fires on the
// figures rather than on the click, and the server's own replace rule
// makes the several frames one leg can produce a single line in the
// record.

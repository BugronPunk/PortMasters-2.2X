// =====================================================================
// [Bilingual Harbor: the captain's language] The client half of the
// language pack. The readers (./game/i18n) answer in whichever language
// the process holds; this file is where a captain's pick is read,
// remembered and applied, and it is three pieces:
//
//   - the pick itself, stored under one localStorage key the way the
//     colorblind preference beside it is (see ./use-color-preference):
//     read once on mount, written on change, no server round trip for
//     the captain's own screen.
//
//   - a readable cookie (pm_locale) kept in step with the pick, because
//     the realtime layer composes some captain facing lines on the
//     server and the socket that carries them reads the cookie at the
//     handshake. It is not a second setting, only the same one written
//     where the other end of the connection can read it.
//
//   - the provider every screen sits under, so the switch reaches the
//     trees that are on screen when the pick is made rather than only
//     the next one that renders.
//
// The module reader is written first in setLanguage on purpose: text
// composed outside React (a ledger line between renders, a value read
// back from storage) has to answer in the new language the moment the
// pick is made, and the state write after it is what redraws the
// screens.
// =====================================================================

// The key the pick is stored under. Named rather than implied, the same
// reading the colorblind key beside it takes. The cookie the server
// reads is named next to the language pair itself (LOCALE_COOKIE_NAME in
// @/lib/game/i18n), because the handshake reader on the other end of the
// connection spells it too.

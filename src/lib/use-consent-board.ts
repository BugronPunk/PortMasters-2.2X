 * parses a board, because both kinds receive the same shape on the wire and
 * only call it different things: `{roomId, contracts}` for the market D3
 * shipped and `{roomId, refits}` for D4's bench, each named once on the
 * server where it is packed (see consentBoard in src/server/realtime). The
 * field name is a contract with every client already connected, so it is
 * read here as the string the server sent rather than inferred from the
 * kind.

/**
 * One captain's view of one kind's board: a thin relay around a consent
 * market's socket events, kept separate from GameState the same way
 * useBarter and useConvoy are, since an agreement between two captains is
 * something no single client's deterministic engine can compute on its own.
 *
 * This hook only tracks the board. The actual Gold and the actual work
 * (the fee moving when the two captains agree, the points going back on a
 * garment, the absorbed raid moving from a seller's purse) are the caller's
 * job, through applyEscortSide or applyRefitSide. Each captain applies
 * their own side to their own state, which is the tree's standing model for
 * cross captain movement, so nothing here reads a purse at all.
 *
 * Noticing rather than being told is what makes that report safe to run in
 * every phase. A row is reported only when it has settled and the status
 * this captain was last shown for it has changed, and only for a row that
 * names this captain on one of its two sides, so a repeated or a stale
 * broadcast cannot move the same Gold twice and a row that came back cannot
 * move anything at all. Which states settle is the primitive's own reading
 * rather than a test taken here (see consentSettled): the escort's decline
 * is a state past the offer stage that commits nobody, so a report that
 * asked only whether a row had stopped being an offer would hand every
 * caller a movement to apply for a price that came back. The caller's own
 * ledger is the second guard: the apply functions are idempotent per
 * movement, which is what carries a captain through a reload midway between
 * an agreement and the Gold that follows it, when this hook has no memory
 * at all and the whole board arrives anew.
 *
 * There is no refund channel here, and that is the difference between a
 * consent market and the barter board. A posted offer holds no escrow,
 * because there is nothing to hand over until the two captains agree, so an
 * offer that is withdrawn or swept away has nothing to give back: leaving
 * the board is the whole of what happened to it.
 *
 * Written once for both kinds rather than twice, on the same reasoning as
 * the server's board factory: the relay is fifty lines of React that has
 * nothing to do with what a contract is for, and the second copy of it
 * would be the one that forgot the stale broadcast guard.

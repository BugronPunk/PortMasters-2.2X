// =====================================================================
// The captain's own rule: what a captain name, a password and a display
// name are allowed to be.
//
// It lives out here rather than in auth.ts because it is read from both
// sides of the wire. The server enforces it (the zod schema in auth.ts
// takes its bounds from here) and both credential cards print it beside
// their fields, so the sentence a captain reads and the rule they are
// held to are one statement of the numbers rather than three.
//
// Deliberately import free of the layers a browser cannot carry. A client
// screen reads this file, and auth.ts next door holds the password hasher
// and the database handle, neither of which can go into a browser bundle.
// The one import below is the language pack's reader, which is a table of
// strings and nothing else.

// Which of the harbor's foldable panels a captain has folded away. Purely a
// client side rendering choice, the same reasoning the colorblind toggle
// follows: read once on mount, write on fold, no server round trip and no
// new trust boundary, since this never changes what any other captain
// sees.
//
// Three keys, two levels. `left` is rail level: the captain's rail gives
// way to a stub beside the stage and the stage takes the width. `roster`
// and `chat` are widget level: on the wide layout either one folds to a
// strip of its own at the rail's outer edge and the other takes the rail,
// so a captain can keep the roster and give the chat the width; below the
// breakpoint the same key folds the panel to its head, the accordion a
// full width row has room for, and the chevron on that head is the way
// back. The right rail itself is not a fourth key: it is folded exactly
// when both of its panels are, derived at the reader rather than stored,
// so the record cannot hold a rail that is empty and yet still standing.

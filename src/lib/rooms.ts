// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: shared room membership helpers
//
// Plain database logic with no Next specific imports, so it can be
// called from API routes and from the realtime layer alike.
// Centralizes what "a player leaves a room" actually means (drop the
// seat, hand off the host crown if they were holding it, remove the
// room entirely once nobody is left in it, unless the caller asks for
// it to be kept), plus the room code generator and the room name
// normalizer that the API routes and the Lobby's create form both call.
// =====================================================================
import { db, PUBLIC_USER_SELECT, type PublicUser } from "./db";
import { normalizeDifficulty } from "./game/difficulty";
import { normalizeMode } from "./game/mode";
import { unlockById } from "./unlock";
import type { RoomDetail, RoomSummary } from "./api";

// Forwarded so callers that work with rooms (the realtime mini
// service, the API routes) can import everything room related from one
// module instead of piecing it together from ./db, ./api, and ./utils.
export type { RoomDetail };

// The one place a room row becomes the shape the client reads.
//
// This object literal was typed out by hand in five different route handlers,
// in three different key orders, with nothing holding them to the same shape.
// A route returns through NextResponse.json, which type checks nothing against
// RoomSummary, so the first copy to lose a field would have shipped a response
// the client believed had it, and no check anywhere would have said a word.
//
// The parameters are structural rather than Prisma types on purpose. Three of
// the five callers hand over a room whose members came back on the row, and
// the other two have already read the seats into a separate list after
// writing one, so the members are passed in beside the room rather than dug
// out of it.
//
// Difficulty and mode both arrive here as bare database strings. They used to
// leave through an `as Difficulty` cast, which is a promise the compiler takes
// on faith and the database never made: any value at all, including one this
// build has never heard of, sailed out of here wearing a valid type. Both now
// pass through their own normalizer, so a room whose row somehow holds
// something unexpected resolves to the founding value instead of handing the
// client a lap or a tier that does not exist. Unlock is read the same way and
// resolves to nothing rather than to a phrase this build does not have, so a
// row opened by a table that has since changed hands reads as an ordinary
// harbor rather than as one wearing a code nobody can name.

// The gate only guards a voyage somebody is actually sailing. A harbor whose
// whole crew has gone home holds no game to interrupt, and the server keeps
// such a harbor standing across a restart, so sealing it would leave a room in
// the lobby that nobody can ever open again. Whoever walks in next may take it
// over. The by code route used to seal on `started` alone, which made the same
// harbor reachable by link and closed to its own code.
//
// A returning member always gets back in. A brief disconnect or a refresh must
// never cost a captain their own seat.
//
// The room parameter is structural, like serializeRoom's, and every caller
// hands over the row it just loaded. That makes this the one place a newly
// seated captain learns which voyage they are joining, so a field dropped
// here is a captain walking into a harbor on the wrong lap with nothing to
// read that says so. Mode is listed beside difficulty for that reason rather
// than because the seating rule reads it, and unlock is listed beside the two
// of them because it is the third thing a seated captain is handed: the table
// they just joined may have been opened by a phrase, and the card they read
// it off is this one.

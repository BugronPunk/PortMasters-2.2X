// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the phase clock, as a client reads it.
//
// [B2: hard timers, the server as timekeeper] The clock belongs to the
// server. It arms a deadline when the harbor's checkpoint moves and
// announces the advance when that deadline passes, whether or not every
// captain has readied, so a table where somebody has walked away still
// turns. What is left here is arithmetic on the two numbers the server
// publishes, and that is all this module is: no timers, no sockets, no
// state.
//
// The remaining time is drawn against the browser's own clock, which is
// safe for exactly one reason: nothing in this file decides anything. The
// transition is the server's, so a captain whose machine has the wrong
// time reads a countdown that is wrong by that much and stands in a harbor
// that moves on schedule anyway. A server timestamp on every frame would
// buy a corrected number for a screen that is not allowed to act on it.
// =====================================================================

// The words below are read at the moment they are composed, so the
// countdown's phrase follows the language of the captain reading it.

 * against. A deadline the server armed a minute ago and this client has
 * only just seen is a deadline with that minute already gone, and a reading
 * taken against anything else would count the minute twice.
 *
 * The three travel together because they are one fact with three parts. A

 * What a captain reads beside the harbor's ready count: "2:05 left", or a
 * phrase instead of a number once the clock has run out, so no screen ever
 * sits on a stubborn 0:00 while the server is moving the harbor on.
 *
 * A whole number of seconds in, a sentence out. The caller draws the glyph
 * if it wants one; this is the words. Both branches read through the pack;
 * the digits frame (the zero padded seconds) is this file's own arithmetic
 * and arrives as the row's {seconds} value.
 *
 * The language is named rather than taken, because the panel that draws
 * the clock knows which language its captain is holding: a countdown that
 * only follows the process's own language waits for the next tick to
 * catch up with a pick the captain has already made.

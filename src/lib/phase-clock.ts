// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the phase clock, as a client reads it.
//
// [B2: hard timers, the server as timekeeper] The clock belongs to the
// server. It arms a deadline when the room's checkpoint moves and
// announces the advance when that deadline passes, whether or not every
// captain has readied, so a table where somebody has walked away still
// turns. What is left here is arithmetic on the two numbers the server
// publishes, and that is all this module is: no timers, no sockets, no
// state.
//
// The remaining time is drawn against the browser's own clock, which is
// safe for exactly one reason: nothing in this file decides anything. The
// transition is the server's, so a captain whose machine has the wrong
// time reads a countdown that is wrong by that much and stands in a room
// that moves on schedule anyway. A server timestamp on every frame would
// buy a corrected number for a screen that is not allowed to act on it.
// =====================================================================

// The words below are read at the moment they are composed, so the
// countdown's phrase follows the language of the captain reading it.

// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: Ocean Gambit alignments.
//
// The one place that decides who is hiding something, and the one place
// that writes down what each card says. It is a data module for the same
// reason ./mode.ts is: the realtime layer draws the cards and the
// interface draws a card back out again, and neither of them should own
// the vocabulary the other has to agree with.
//
// A card is a role, plus a flourish for the majority of the table: the
// personal goal an Honest captain carries on top of the fleet's
// commission. The flourish deck is keyed by the objective rather than
// drawn from a pool of its own, because the rule for it is that the
// personal goal and the public one are authored together. A flourish
// that did not name the goods its own fleet is being asked for would be
// a second objective rather than a share in this one.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock, a database or a socket, and the draw takes
// its randomness as an argument rather than reaching for one. That last
// part is the whole spine of the mode. The engine is deterministic by
// composition, seeded from values the client already knows, which is what
// lets the server stay out of the simulation; a hidden role cannot be
// drawn from a value the captain can read. So the seed for this draw is
// minted by the server at departure, used once, and thrown away. What is
// kept is the rows it produced, which is what a reload replays from. See
// src/server/realtime/gambit.ts for the half that owns the seed.

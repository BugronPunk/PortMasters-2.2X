// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: Maroon, and the Harbormaster's hand.
//
// [H7: Maroon and the Harbormaster] The harbor's second vote, and the
// heavier one. From the mode's rung, once a voyage, two thirds of the
// captains still sailing may put one captain ashore: they lose the ship
// and everything on it, keep half their Gold, and are handed the one
// power in the mode that is not about their own books. From then on,
// once a leg, they may name a port and lean every price at it by a tenth
// in either direction, in front of the whole table.
//
// The vote is modeled on the Manifest Audit's (see ./audit) and the
// difference between them is the whole point of the pair. The audit is
// one round of evidence at a simple majority and costs the table its
// trading; marooning is a two thirds majority from late in the voyage,
// costs one captain everything they own, and is deliberately the harder
// of the two to call. A harbor that can open a manifest will not
// necessarily be able to put anyone ashore, and the arithmetic below is
// where that shows.
//
// What is NOT here is as deliberate. This module does not decide whether
// the power is available: the rung lives on the mode (see ModeConfig in
// ./mode, and maroonFrom in particular), beside the other rule that
// decides a seat's fate. It does not run the vote or hold the room's
// record of it either, for the reason nothing else in this tree splits a
// rule across two owners: the arithmetic is here so it can be tested
// without a socket, and the room state is next to the socket that needs
// it (see src/server/realtime/maroon.ts).
//
// Pure: no socket, no database, no clock.

 * Two thirds of the active roster, counted from the roster rather than

 *
 * The count is inclusive, and that is the only reading that means
 * anything at the sizes a harbor is dealt. Strictly more than two thirds
 * of a table of three is three votes, which is unanimity and therefore
 * not a vote at all; two thirds of three is two, and a two thirds
 * majority is what the plan asks for. At six the fraction lands on a
 * whole seat and both readings agree. It is that inclusive two thirds
 * that maroonNamesNeeded below writes as a whole count of names, so the
 * card that quotes the share and the server that decides on it answer
 * out of one arithmetic.
 *
 * Two captains cannot both hold two thirds of one roster, since two
 * disjoint two thirds do not fit inside a whole for any table this game
 * deals, so the walk itself cannot be order dependent: whichever target
 * the map is walked to first is the only one that can be over the
 * threshold. The walk is the audit's own rather than a second copy of it
 * (see carriedTarget in ./audit): the two votes count the same books at
 * different thresholds, and the counting is the part that has to agree.

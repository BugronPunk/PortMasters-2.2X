// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the draft, and the switch.
//
// [D7: the draft, and switching] The plan's clause, and the whole of it:
// "Deal each captain three path cards face down from a deck seeded so at
// least two Quartermaster cards are in circulation. Keep one, pass two to
// the left, keep one of the two received, pass one, discard the last. Then
// switching: once per voyage, at a port, legs three through nine,
// forfeiting unfulfilled pathbound orders and paying a Refit fee scaled to
// Renown, and the switch is published to the fleet log where everyone
// sees it."
//
// This module is the rule half of that sentence and holds no state and no
// socket: the deck, the pass, the window (both the legs it spans and the
// seats it opens on) and the fee. The hand a captain is dealt is private
// information and is dealt by the server (see src/server/realtime/draft),
// which is the plan's own reason ("a hand of cards is private information
// and the client cannot be trusted to deal it"), and the one thing that
// crosses back into a save is the path a captain kept, written by the
// engine half (see applyDraftPath in ./engine/draft).
//
// The reading of the pass rule, written down here because the sentence
// carries two keeps and one discard and a reader is owed the arithmetic:
// a captain holds two cards when the passing is done, the one they kept
// from their dealt three and the one they kept from the two they received,
// and the last step is the discard that leaves them one path. Which of the
// two the captain keeps is the captain's own, and that is the reading
// rather than a taste: the other way to read "discard the last", as a
// discard prescribed to the second keep, would leave the dealt three
// unable to change the outcome if the first keep were held, and the
// received pair unable to change it if the second were, and the plan's own
// evaluation asks that "taking it is a choice somebody makes rather than a
// duty somebody gets assigned".
//
// Every function here is pure, so the suite can hold the whole rule
// without a server, which is the shape D6's opportunist module set.

 * How much of the deck each path is worth, as a weight.

 * The plan's iteration note is why this is a table rather than a constant
 * in the deal: "Tune the deck composition separately from the pass rules,
 * because those are two different knobs and the proposal's balance targets
 * will move the first one repeatedly." The weights are level today, which
 * puts five paths on the plan's own twelve to twenty eight percent band by
 * construction rather than by tuning, and the entry a reader is looking
 * for is the one they would turn: a heavier weight is a path the fleet
 * meets more often.
 *
 * It is typed as a record of every path, so the day a sixth path lands in
 * ./paths this table is a compile error rather than a path that silently
 * never appears in a draft, which is the same property the id type itself
 * was built for.
 *
 * It is not exported, and that is the tuning knob's own reading rather than
 * a habit: this is the one table a balance pass turns, and a table is turned
 * where it is written. Nothing outside this module has an opinion about the
 * weights, which is what the composition below being their only reader says.

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the captain's ledger.
//
// The ledger is the record a captain keeps of their own voyage: the lines
// their ship writes as the voyage goes on, read in the rail's own Ledger
// tab and popped up as a notification when an action writes to it.
//
// The one rule this module exists to hold is that a line is not a
// sentence but the material a sentence is made of. A ledger that stores
// sentences is a ledger that has frozen the language it was written in:
// the sentence a line becomes is chosen when the line is written, so a
// captain who picks another language halfway through a voyage is left
// reading a ledger that starts in one language and ends in another, and a
// table of captains reading the same harbor sees two different ledgers
// for the same voyage.
//
// So a line is held as the English it was written in and the values it is
// written with, and the sentence is built at the read, in the language
// the reader is holding. That is the discipline the harbor's own log
// already keeps (see ./voyage-log, which holds the facts of a line and
// builds the sentence for each captain who reads it), and the reason the
// two read alike.
//
// The values are held the same way. A name the pack carries is held as
// the name and read through the pack at the sentence's own moment, so a
// line naming a good, a path or a task reads in the reader's language
// rather than in the language the voyage began in. A value that is not a
// word the pack knows, such as a count, prints as itself.
//
// The English a line is written in is also what the pack is keyed by, so
// the material a line is made of is the same string the pack carries:
// there is no second copy of the tree to keep in step, and a line the
// pack has no leaf for prints itself rather than vanishing.

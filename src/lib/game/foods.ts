// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the three foods and the sea's clock.
//
// [C4: three foods, spoilage and the split hold] C1 shipped a Larder that
// was a plain number, and said so in its own header: "The survival
// edition eventually carries three of those, with spoilage and a split
// hold, and all of that is C4's." This module is that promise kept. A
// ration is still a ration and the number on the screen is still how many
// are aboard; what is new is that the number now has an account, and the
// account knows what each meal is and when it came aboard.
//
// One account, one count. The count is the game's number: the HUD, the
// audit's reveal, the shortage rule and the voyage summary all read
// .larder and none of them changed. The lots are where that number comes
// from, and they are the only thing spoilage can read, because only a
// batch knows its own age. The two are written in the same statement by
// every writer in this module and in ./larder, and the one door a foreign
// save can come through reconciles them: on load the account wins, since
// lots are the more specific fact, and the count is set to their sum
// rather than the other way around. Nothing here ever invents food.
//
// Batches rather than a number per food, and the reason is the rot. A
// count per food with a single stamp would refresh the whole stack every
// time a captain bought one more meal of it, and rot a captain can dodge
// by buying a mouthful is not a rule, it is a screen. A lot is what was
// bought, and it ages from the leg it was bought in.
//
// The order is the second decision. The crew eats whatever spoils first,
// which is why FOODS_DRAW_ORDER runs Produce, Salt Fish, Grain, and the
// lots are kept sorted into that order rather than sorted at dinner: the
// head of the list is always the next meal, oldest first within a food,
// and eating is a walk from the head. A captain who keeps grain and buys
// produce is eating the produce, which is both the sensible rule and the
// one that makes the three foods mean something.
//
// Grain absorbs. When a count and an account disagree, or when a save
// arrives with a count and no account, the difference lands on grain:
// the food that never turns is the one whose age nothing can be wrong
// about, so it is the one that can take an unknown age without lying
// about one. This is the same choice ./larder's own reader makes for a
// save that predates the pantry, and it is made twice because it is made
// at two doors, the load and the write.
//
// Pure: no clock, no socket, no database. The age of a lot is a round
// number and the leg is the only clock this module has, which is what the
// plan asks for when it says spoilage "must be part of the deterministic
// resolve step and may not read a clock".

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: garments and the cold.
//
// [C3: garments and the cold] One data model for three jobs, which is what
// the plan asks for and what this module is: a garment is a finished good
// with a warmth rating and a durability, the weather is a tag on a leg, and
// the check between them decides who freezes.
//
// The garments are the tree's own clothes rather than three new goods.
// Linen Clothes is the hemp garment, Cotton Clothes the cloth one and
// Brocade the fine silk, which is the mapping the plan's ratings one, two
// and three are written onto (see GARMENTS in ./constants for the table and
// for why the Sachet is not in it). That choice is what makes the plan's
// own evaluation readable in this tree rather than in a new one: the fine
// silks a captain either wears or sells are Brocade, a good that already
// has a recipe, a price and a customer.
//
// Three things about the shape are decisions rather than readings.
//
// A worn garment is one way. Wearing is the decision, and a garment taken
// off and put back on would be a durability bar with extra steps: it would
// be the one way a captain could reset a fraction, and the plan says the
// player never manages a bar. So a garment that goes on stays on until the
// sea has had it, and the panel says so before the button is pressed.
//
// Warmth is a sum, not a bar. What a garment gives is its rating times the
// fraction of itself that is left, and that is the number the check reads
// and the number the panel prints. Nothing anywhere draws a durability
// meter, because the plan's sentence is that a multiplier is a decision.
//
// A garment at zero leaves the wardrobe and pays the plan's four Gold as
// scrap, which is the one way this tree can give a finished good a cash value
// outside an order or a barter (see RAG_SCRAP_VALUE in ./constants). The
// scrap is a good like any other rather than a bare number on the state,
// named in the catalogue the Loom's bench buys it off the quay from and
// reweaves (see RAGS there). What a rag is worth and what it turns back
// into are not read here: they belong to the bench's own arithmetic.
//
// The weather is drawn rather than stored. Every input the tag needs is
// already harbor wide on the state, so one function answers for the whole
// harbor, replays on reload, and needs no field, no stamp and no context to
// thread: see legIsCold below.
//
// The load site heals the wardrobe the way every other saved field is
// healed (see normalizeGarments), and the settlement tick is one line in
// ./engine/lifecycle beside the wage bill it lands with.
//
// Pure: no clock, no socket, no database. The one environment read is
// deliberate and it is documented where it happens.

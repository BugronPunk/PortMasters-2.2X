// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the telemetry spine.
//
// [I1: the telemetry spine] One typed event vocabulary, and the record a
// voyage leaves behind. The plan asks for three things from this module
// and nothing else: every event is typed, every event carries a version,
// a voyage identifier and a leg number, and a voyage produces a record
// whether it concludes or stops halfway.
//
// The vocabulary is a table rather than a union of loose shapes, the way
// ./mode.ts and ./difficulty.ts are tables, so the family an event belongs
// to is declared beside the event itself. A reader that wants "the market
// family" then asks the table rather than matching on strings, and an
// event cannot be added without deciding what it measures.
//
// Four families are instrumented in this build and one is not, and the one
// that is not is named here rather than left for a reader to notice: the
// build layer waits on Epic F, and the market family ships without the
// Chandler and Bale lines because both are Epic G's. A family with no event
// in it is not a family this table can name, which is why the absent one is
// prose here and a value there.
//
// Two families that were once named here as absent have landed since, and
// where their numbers went is worth the line rather than the silence: the
// survival layer (Epic C) reports through the leg report's own fields,
// because what it measures is per captain per leg, and the paths (Epic D)
// read the same way except at their two discrete moments, which are the
// events D7 added below. Neither needed a family of its own, because a
// family is a group of events and both are a handful of numbers inside one
// captain's leg.
//
// The business family's return numbers, day one and day seven and the
// second session on the evening, are not events either, and deliberately
// so: a captain coming back is not something a voyage knows, it is what a
// later reader finds by looking at two records that name the same
// captain. The record carries the identifiers and the timestamps that
// join makes, and the numbers are a query over them.
//
// Nothing in this module reads a clock, a database or a socket. The
// server's accumulator (src/server/realtime/telemetry.ts) is the half
// that does, and it is thin on purpose: it stamps the time, keeps the
// events for one voyage in memory, and writes the record once the voyage
// is over.
//
// One rule shapes the whole record: a telemetry write must never be able
// to stop a voyage, so the accumulator holds events in memory and the
// write happens once, at the end, and is logged rather than thrown if it
// fails. The cap below exists for the same reason: a client that reports
// a leg ten thousand times must not be able to grow a record without
// bound.
// =====================================================================

// The version every event carries. It is bumped when the meaning of an
// existing event changes, which is what lets a later reader trust an old
// record rather than guess at it.

// How a recorded voyage stopped. The plan's own words for the middle case
// are "abandons mid leg", and the three values below are the three ways a
// voyage this tree can start also ends: it concludes, the host wipes it,
// or the harbor empties out from under it.

// header explains are absent here rather than present and empty.
type TelemetryFamily = "loop" | "market" | "social" | "business";

// Every event this build emits, with the fields it carries. Each one
// carries its own leg because a record is read by leg, and a leg is the
// unit both the plan and the harbor already count in.
//
// One happening is one event, which is why a settled trade appears once,
// as the offer it filled, and never as a second "trade" line in the loop
// family: two events for one accept would have a reader adding the same
// goods up twice.
export interface TelemetryPayloads {
  // ==== loop ====
  // A round closed and the next one opened. This is the spine's clock:
  // every other event is placed by the leg it happened in, and this is
  // what says which legs a voyage actually reached.
  leg_advanced: { leg: number };
  // What only a client can see, reported once per leg per captain: the
  // orders the leg dealt them, the ones they filled, and the goods their
  // hold closed the leg carrying. The plan asks for the orders that
  // expired unfulfilled, and that number is dealt minus filled, worked out
  // by the reader rather than stored twice. A client's report is a claim
  // and is kept as one: this is a measurement of what a captain played,
  // not a score, and nothing in the game reads it.
  //
  // Two of the proposal's market numbers are deliberately not here.
  // Chandler share and Bale usage are Epic G's, and they are absent for
  // that reason rather than because nobody got to them. The third, median
  // hold utilization, is read against the hold's own size, which is the one
  // C4's split hold gave it. The four fields below are that answer and the
  // pantry reading that came with it.
  //
  // The survival family is undeclared above, and this is where that is
  // answered rather than left as a gap for a reader to guess at. Four
  // numbers belong to it: short rationed legs, crew losses, frostbite, and
  // the Supply Barge's share of food spending. Two of the four now have a
  // source and neither of them is here. The shortage and the pantry ride
  // the loop family's report below, because a leg is where both of them
  // happen and a captain is who they happen to, and the Barge's two
  // counters ride it for the same reason: what the plan measures about
  // this feature is what a captain spent at the till, which is a fact
  // about a leg of a voyage rather than a family of its own. What has
  // still not landed is the reason to write a survival event at all:
  // nothing in this build reads the family, C1's own evaluation watches
  // what the room says in the leg after a captain visibly goes hungry
  // rather than a stored count of it, and a family declared ahead of the
  // events that would fill it is a schema with no rows in it. It arrives
  // with the epic that measures it.
  //
  // [C4: three foods, spoilage and the split hold] The last four fields
  // are one reading the plan asks for and three it does not, and the
  // difference is which of them a dashboard divides by something. The
  // slots are the numerator the utilization row reads, and they are absent
  // on any leg whose voyage was not playing the split hold, because a
  // hold with no size has no utilization to report and a zero there would
  // read as an empty ship rather than as an unmeasured one. The three
  // meal counts are the plan's own evaluation of this feature, "watch the
  // mix of foods actually carried", and they are a record rather than a
  // gate: no threshold in the plan puts one food's share inside a band, so
  // a later reader compares the three against each other rather than
  // against a line this reader would have had to invent. All four are
  // absent together on a leg sailed with the survival layer off, for the
  // reason every field of a switched off layer is absent: the record says
  // what happened rather than what the build could have measured.

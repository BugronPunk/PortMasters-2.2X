// =====================================================================
// [F2: the card record, and the mode weighting field] The pool: every boon
// and every module, written as one card record each (see ./cards for the
// shape and the vocabulary). The tags sit here beside the id and the
// prose because a card's tags are part of what the card is, and the rest
// of the record is here for the same reason; the fields it carries are
// the ones that were previously nowhere or in the wrong place:
//
//   - The prose was a good's name in ten of these cards. Silk Winds named
//     Silk, Hemp Monopoly named Hemp, the Fleet of Treasures named Foreign
//     Balm and Pearl String. Every one of them now names the tag its effect
//     actually reads, which is F1's rule ("effects name tags, never item
//     keys") applied to the copy a captain reads rather than only to the
//     engine. Three cards are renamed to match what they do, and their ids
//     are deliberately not: an id is a handle a standing order and a saved
//     voyage already hold, so a retune moves the caption and leaves the
//     handle where it is (the same reading ./paths.ts takes of a persisted
//     name).
//
//   - The offer weights were a switch statement in the engine, keyed by id
//     and reading inventory and roster by name. They are now a condition on
//     the record, in the three or four shapes the engine actually needs,
//     and the engine holds no card's id at all.
//
//   - The mode list and the power budget are new, and they are the pair
//     that gives the two modes different pools. Classic runs a ceiling of
//     three, so the three cards above it below carry a zero there: the two
//     that bend the whole ledger (Tax Evasion and the Woven Monopoly) and
//     the one that halves two risks at once (the Deep Sea Escort Pact).
//     Ocean Gambit runs the whole pool. Both weightings are authored here
//     from the start, which is the plan's rollback clause: switching a mode
//     between the tight pool and the wide one is a config change.
//
//   - The second language is authored beside the first for every card, so
//     the translation pass J3 describes is a pass over a pool that already
//     carries both, and a card that arrives later cannot arrive with one
//     string and pass review: the content check fails the build.

// ("The pool should stay small at launch, and the first widening should
// target the paths with the lowest pick rate"), which is why each card
// carries a path lean from the first wave rather than none.
//
// The list stands outside the three tier ladders on purpose, and that
// placement is the round draft's whole protection: unlockedBoons walks
// the ladders (see ./pools), so a card here can never appear in a
// round's three, and it appears in the milestone draw alone. It rides
// ./cards' CARDS for everything else, the door, the tally, the validator
// and the flag lookup, so a milestone boon is a card like any other the
// moment it is on a table.
//
// Every condition is the always arm, because the moment is the
// conditioning: the crew loss card is worth the same to a rich captain
// and a broke one, and what decides which of these a captain sees is
// which moment arrived and which of the five they already hold.
//
// Each card writes a key of its own. The five keys are new here (see
// MODIFIER_KEYS in ../types), and no round drafted card writes any of
// them, so a held boon and a round boon are never in force on the same
// key: the pool's one owner per key clause (see the validator in
// ../cards) holds the line, and the pricing breakdown's source line
// stays true without a second rule.

// =====================================================================
// The five moments a boon can arrive
// at, and the words a captain meets when one does.
//
// This is the vocabulary and nothing else, the same split the tags and the
// card shape took: the words live here and the walk that reads them lives
// in ../milestones, so a module that wants to ask what a moment is imports
// this one, and a module that wants to know whether one is due imports
// that one.
//
// The five triggers, in the order the checks walk:
//
//   - crew_loss. Losing a hand, read off the list the crew module writes
//     the moment a hand goes (see ../crew).
//
//   - pathbound_order. The first order along the captain's path, read at
//     the completion of an order carrying the path's own mark (see
//     ./engine/orders and isPathOrder in ../types).
//
//   - renown_rung. Crossing a Reputation rung. The tree grants Renown,
//     the account level, only at a voyage's conclusion, so no mid voyage
//     crossing exists to fire on and a boon dealt after the books close
//     would be dealt to a finished voyage. The smallest honest reading is
//     taken instead: the voyage's own Reputation crossing a rung of the
//     ladder the game already prints to a captain (see MERCHANT_RATINGS
//     in ./reputation), so the rungs move with that one table. The
//     captain facing copy below says Reputation, because that is the
//     number on their rail.
//
//   - cold_round. Surviving a cold round with zero frostbite, read off the
//     settlement tick's own marks (see ../garments): the round was cold
//     and no hand carries a frostbite written for the round after it.
//
//   - mandate. Contributing to a Joint Mandate, read at the first
//     delivery to the voyage's shared commission (see
//     ./engine/objectives).
// =====================================================================

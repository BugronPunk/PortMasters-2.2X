// two stopped being the same list the day Rags arrived. Rags is cargo: it
// takes a slot, it is priced, and it is bought and sold in this file. What
// it is not is a market good, since the plan gives one path the exclusive
// right to buy it, so its only seller is the harbor's own pile and its only
// shelf is the Loom's bench. A panel that lists what the market trades reads
// MARKET_GOODS, and a panel that counts what a hold can carry reads ITEMS,

// the catalogue above cannot ship untagged, because the missing row is a
// type error before it is a check finding.
//
// The assignment is a reading of each good rather than a balance dial, and
// where the tree already keeps a number about a good the tag is read
// against it. Three of these rows are held to their number by the rule
// module: every garment in GARMENTS carries cold, because a cold leg asks
// the wardrobe for warmth and the wardrobe's own table is where that
// question lives, and Rags carries woven because it is what a garment
// comes to when the sea has had all of it.
//
// The rest are authored, and two of them are the readings a second author
// would most likely make differently, so they are written down instead of
// left to be inferred. Hemp is bulk and woven together: it is the cheap
// fibre, the good a hold fills with, and it is also the thread Linen
// Clothes is spun from, so a card about the cloth trade and a card about
// the heavy trade both have a claim on it. Tea and Spices are perishable
// because both are aromatics, which is the one property a merchant of
// this catalogue would actually worry about on a long haul, and neither
// is held to a number here because no rule in this tree ages a trade
// good: the tag is a claim about the good, and the day a rule reads it is
// the day it becomes checkable (see G3's perishability axis).

// game: an offer moves goods outside the market entirely, from any phase,
// to any captain in the harbor. Two limits hold it in check, and both live
// here so that a screen and the server can never disagree about either one.
//
// The first limit is who may take part. Both captains have to be at Renown
// Level 10, the level the flexible composer opens at, before either end of
// a trade is allowed, not merely the captain posting it. Gating the poster
// alone would leave the sharper half of the problem open, because the
// captain doing the harder job in a swap is the one accepting: they are the
// one who has to judge whether what is on the other side is worth what it
// costs them. Requiring both sides also keeps the feature alive in a mixed
// harbor, since two level 10 captains can still trade with each other while a
// newer captain sits at the same table, and no harbor is ever vetoed by its
// least established member. None of this reaches the Captain's Exchange,
// which is open to every captain at every level.
//
// The second limit is how often. One completed trade per voyage at level
// 10, two at level 15. The allowance is spent by a completed trade and
// never by posting, so while any of it is left a captain may advertise the
// same intent in several places at once and take whichever answer arrives
// first. Only the poster's own allowance is ever spent, and posting is
// refused only once it is gone: accepting is not rationed on either
// surface, so a captain whose offers have all been taken can still take
// anyone else's.

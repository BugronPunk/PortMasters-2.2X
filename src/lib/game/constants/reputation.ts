// Why there is a ceiling at all: without one this was the only exploit in
// the game that needed no tampering. Two captains agree in chat, one
// requests a large loan, the other grants it and banks a fifth of it as
// Reputation, and the borrower hands the Gold straight back. aid:post
// accepts any whole number, so the pair could repeat that until Reputation
// stopped meaning anything. Capping the total rather than a single loan is
// what closes it: splitting one large loan into ten small ones earns
// exactly the same.
//
// Why it is derived rather than written down: a sixteen round Monsoon
// voyage offers twice the chances to help that an eight round Fair Winds
// one does, and holds far more Gold by its midpoint. One fixed number for
// all three tiers is either mean to the long voyage or generous to the
// short one. Scaling with the tier's own length lets the ceiling breathe,
// and means a tier added later gets a sensible allowance without anyone
// remembering to come back here.
//
// The base covers a captain who is generous early in a short voyage; the
// per round term is what a long voyage adds on top. At the shipped tiers
// that works out to 96, 120 and 144, each worth five times its own number
// in Gold lent, or ten times in Gold pledged and returned whole.
//
// On the longest tier this does pass 100, the Successful Merchant rating.
// That is deliberate and not the loophole it looks like: Reputation earned
// this way requires Gold, and Gold has to be traded for first. A captain
// cannot lend their way up the ladder without having earned the stake to
// lend, so the ladder still measures trading.

// =====================================================================
// [F6: charters at leg four] The ten charters, two for each of the five
// paths, and the moment a voyage offers one of them.
//
// This is the vocabulary and nothing else, the same split F1 took with
// the tags and F4 with the moments: the words live here and the walk
// that reads them lives in ../charters, so a module that wants to ask
// what a charter is imports this one, and a module that wants to know
// whether one is due imports that one.
//
//   - A charter is offered once a voyage, at leg four, and the choice
//     carries to the end of it. The plan's shape for the offer is a
//     trio: the captain's two path charters, and one wildcard drawn at
//     even weight from the other eight. The pairing lives here in
//     CHARTER_PATH rather than in each record's own pathWeight, because
//     the trio is composed by the reader rather than by the weighted
//     draw the two older drafts run, and a lean written beside the pair
//     would be the same fact in a second place. The records carry
//     NO_LEAN for that reason, and the validator holds the two per path
//     count against this one map.
//
//   - The wildcard is drawn flat: every record's condition is the always
//     arm at weight one, so nothing about a captain bends the third slot
//     of their trio. That is what keeps the dashboard's cover row an
//     honest number (see COVER_CHARTERS below): a card any captain can
//     be offered is what lets the row read the pool rather than read who
//     happened to be dealt what.
//
//   - Every charter runs Ocean Gambit's pool alone. Power four is the
//     floor that follows rather than a taste: a card absent from Classic
//     must sit above Classic's ceiling of three, which the mode clause
//     in ../cards enforces, and four is that floor. The Factor sits at
//     five, the wide ceiling itself, as the one whose strength is a rule
//     rather than a rate.
//
//   - The trigger is the one value charter_draft, and every record names
//     it in its own field the same way a boon does. A charter's kind
//     needed no new vocabulary: CardKind carried the third word from F2
//     (see ./cards), so what F6 adds to the shape is content rather than
//     a field, which is the widening the pool record was built to take.
//
// Every line is dash free by the house rule, and none of them names an
// item: the same two scans the card pool answers to are run over these
// strings by the suite.

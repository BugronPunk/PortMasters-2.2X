🧭 This Voyage: ${play.badge}
${play.tagline}
${changes}
🚢 Objective:
Sail one voyage of ${rounds} rounds, and finish it with the highest Reputation in the harbor.

⚖️ If Your Books Fail:
${play.failureRule}

📦 Goods System:
Raw Materials: ${priceRangeLine(RESOURCES_TIER0)}
Finished Goods: ${priceRangeLine(PRODUCTS_TIER0)}

👥 Worker System:
${workerLine("weaver", "Linen or Cotton Clothes")}
${workerLine("master", "Linen, Cotton or Brocade")}
${workerLine("sachet_maker", "Sachets")}

🧾 Tax System:
• VAT: ${Math.round(VAT_RATE * 100)}% on finished product profit margin
• Income Tax: ${Math.round(INCOME_TAX_RATE * 100)}% on your net profit for the round, charged at Resolve after everything else is paid

🔮 Broker's Whisper:
• Market: Click "Broker's Rumor Board" to open the window
• Spend ${INTEL_COST} Gold to buy a "rumor" about Orders demand
• Revealed intel guarantees matching orders will appear
• A rumor is always true and always delivered, on every tier${cfg.brokerCorruption ? `\n• Here a broker may still be corrupt: you get the true rumor, but your position leaks and this round's raid risk rises, and the log tells you when` : ""}

🤝 Parley (Bartering):
• Trade directly with the other captains in your harbor while the Parley is open, whether it falls before or after Orders on your voyage
• Post what you have and what you want for it; anyone can accept it with one click
• An offer can't be an item for itself, and both amounts must be whole numbers of at least 1
• You can never offer more than you currently own, it's set aside the moment you post, and returned to you if you cancel or nobody takes it
• Want to make sure a specific captain gets your offer, not whoever clicks fastest? Pick their name under "With" when you post: only the two of you will ever see it

🔧 Ship Modules:
• Dusk: Upgrade your ship to unlock Module Slots
• Draft powerful modules to create unique synergies
• Swap modules to adapt to your current voyage!

🏴‍☠️ Pirates and Escorts:
• Resolve: ${raidCopy(cfg)} Pirates take every Gold coin you carry.
• Hire an escort for ${escortPct(cfg)} of current Gold to sail safe
• Decide before the pirate roll happens that round${mandates.length ? `\n\n📜 Imperial Mandates:\n• On round${mandates.length === 1 ? "" : "s"} ${mandates.join(", ")} the Emperor commissions one large order at a fixed reward\n• A mandate is the only order exempt from VAT\n• Every captain in the harbor is dealt the same mandate, so it is a race` : ""}

📣 Word on the Docks:
• Whichever captain is first in the harbor to complete ${WORD_ON_THE_DOCKS_THRESHOLD} trade orders total this voyage wins ${WORD_ON_THE_DOCKS_REWARD} Gold on the spot
• It's a race against the rest of the harbor, not a scheduled event: it can land on any round, for any captain
• Announced to the whole harbor the moment it's won, same as any other harbor wide milestone

🌊 Tidewatch Alerts:
• Once everyone in the harbor's own Reputation adds up past ${TIDEWATCH_SURGE_THRESHOLD}, the harbor takes notice of a bustling crew
• From the next Port Purchase onward, every captain's board gets one extra cargo lot, for the rest of the voyage
• This never changes your voyage length or which tier's goods you see, only how busy the market gets

⚓ Ventures:
• Found on the Dues tab of your captain's rail: any captain can post a venture, a Gold target and a deadline round
• Anyone in the harbor, including the poster, can chip in Gold toward that target at any time before the deadline
• Reach the target in time and it fills: every contributor is paid back ${Math.round((CONVOY_VENTURE_PAYOUT_MULTIPLIER - 1) * 100)}% more Gold than they put in, split in exact proportion to their share
• Miss the deadline and it fails: every contributor only gets back ${Math.round(CONVOY_VENTURE_FAILURE_REFUND_RATE * 100)}% of their own stake, the rest is lost
• Contributing is a real wager on the rest of the harbor coming through, not a free favor
• Your whole harbor only ever gets one filled venture per voyage: the moment any venture fills, every other open venture is canceled and fully refunded, and posting a new one is disabled until the next voyage
• A deadline can never land on your voyage's final round: it always leaves at least one full round afterward to actually spend whatever you're paid
• No single captain can ever fund more than ${Math.round(CONVOY_VENTURE_MAX_CONTRIBUTOR_SHARE * 100)}% of a venture's target alone: it always needs at least one other captain to fund the rest before it can fill

🆘 Financial Aid:
• Can't cover this round's wages or maintenance? When other captains are aboard, ask the harbor for a loan, right on the settlement screen
• Any captain with enough Gold can lend it to you on the spot; it's in your hands immediately
• Repay it any time before the voyage's last round ends, or it's taken from your funds automatically and handed to your lender
• Still short when the voyage finishes? That unpaid loan is what bankrupts you, not the round it was borrowed in
• Lending Gold raises your own reputation, scaled to how much you lent

🛡️ Backing:
• Every outstanding loan in your harbor is visible on the settlement screen, to everyone, not just the lender and borrower
• A third captain can back one: pledge some of their own Gold as a safety net for the lender, escrowed the instant they pledge it
• Only spent if the loan actually defaults, and only up to whatever was pledged; the lender still eats any shortfall past that
• Never called on when the loan is repaid in full? The whole pledge comes back, plus a small Reputation bonus for the risk paying off
• One backer per loan; you can't back a loan you're the lender or borrower on yourself

Captain's Legacy:
• Every voyage's final Reputation becomes Renown XP on your account the moment the voyage ends, win or lose
• Renown is permanent: it survives a restart and carries into every future voyage, in any harbor, unlike Gold, cargo, and ship level
• ${RENOWN_BONUS_LINE}
• Whoever ends a voyage with the highest Reputation among everyone who reached the endgame screen is crowned Sea Master
• Check your current Renown level, title, and Sea Master crowns any time from the Lobby

// Broker's Favor: a Renown gated, once per voyage skill a captain invokes in

// a good they are already holding, so a hold full of otherwise unsellable
// stock still has a buyer. Unlocks at Renown Level 5 (the Trade Officer
// tier, see src/lib/game/legacy.ts). A captain may ask for any quantity up
// to their full hold; the Broker's commission (see brokersFavorCommission in
// engine.ts) is a saturating curve rather than a flat rate, so net payout

// (GameState.score) sums past this, harbor wide, the harbor takes notice of a

// targetGold, splitting a reward (targetGold times the payout multiplier)
// across every contributor in exact proportion to what they put in. Missing
// the deadline instead pays every contributor back only a fraction of their
// own stake, so joining one is a real wager on the harbor finishing it, not a

// which is worse than the original repeat fill exploit: it still prints a
// bounded amount of free Gold, and it burns the whole harbor's one shared
// chance for the voyage in the process, locking every other captain out

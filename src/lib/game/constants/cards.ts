// =====================================================================
// [F2: the card record, and the mode weighting field] The shape every
// offered card is written in, and the vocabulary the shape is spelled
// with. One record for boons, modules and charters alike, carrying the
// plan's ten fields: identifier, kind, power, tags, path weight, trigger,
// condition, effect, mode list, and both language strings (see Epic F of
// docs/OCEAN_GAMBIT_AGILE_PLAN.md).
//
// This file is the vocabulary and nothing else, the same split F1 took
// with the tags: the words live here and the walk that reads them lives
// in ./cards, so a module that wants to ask a question about a card
// imports this one and a module that wants to answer one imports that
// one. Nothing here reads a game state, a world fact or a clock.
//
//   - The identifier is a string rather than a literal union. A tag list
//     is a closed twelve and a path is a closed five, so both derive their
//     id types from their own record; a card pool is not closed, it is
//     widened in waves (F2's own iteration says to ship it small and widen
//     it), and a union of literals would be a union that every wave edits
//     by hand. What holds a card id to the pool is the registry in ./cards
//     and the clause that no two records share one, both checkable at load
//     rather than at review.
//
//   - The kind names where a card can come from, and the trigger names the
//     draft that offers it. The three kinds are the plan's three, and the
//     trigger for each is written once in CARD_TRIGGER rather than beside
//     every card: a card that arrives at the boon draft and says so in its
//     own words is a card that can disagree with its own kind.
//
//   - Power is a card's weight in the balance ledger, authored rather than
//     derived, because F7 spends it as a budget ("Every card carries a
//     power budget and a captain's total is capped") and a derived number
//     is one nobody can retune without moving a rule. The mode list is
//     what turns it into a ceiling: a mode runs a ceiling and a card above
//     that ceiling is absent from that mode's pool, which is the plan's
//     own reading of the variance problem ("the base competitive mode
//     should run lower ceilings, since there your good luck is somebody
//     else's bad evening, while Ocean Gambit can run the wild pool,
//     because the headline objective is shared").
//
//   - Both language strings are carried from the beginning, which is what
//     makes the translation pass a pass rather than a rebuild (J3: "The
//     card record in F2 carries both strings from the beginning, so this
//     goal is a translation pass rather than a structural change"). The
//     shipped language is named rather than assumed, so the day a captain
//     picks one, the pick is one value and not a second copy of the pool.
//
//   - The condition is what makes an offer fit the captain it is offered
//     to, and it is a closed list of questions the engine already knows
//     how to ask. It deliberately reads tags and roles rather than goods
//     and ids, which is F1's rule ("No effect ever names an item key")
//     applied to the offer gate as well as to the effect: a card that
//     gates on a good named in its own record is a card the tag system
//     cannot widen later.
//
//   - Path weight is the lean, not the filter, and the plan is explicit
//     that this is the point: "Path weighting is what makes an offer feel
//     like it belongs to you without locking you out of the rest of the
//     pool, so the three presented cards are drawn from a weighted pool
//     rather than a filtered one." A weight below one leans away and a
//     weight above one leans toward; there is no weight that removes a
//     card from a path, and the validator holds that line.

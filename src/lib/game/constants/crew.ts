// The two things the loss rule needs, kept here

// content pass both find theirs where they already look.
//
// The run is the design's own number, and it is written down rather than
// inlined where it is read: "two consecutive rounds on Short Rations costs a
// crew member" is the rule, so a later tune that moved it to three should
// cost one edit with the design's own sentence as the note beside it.
//
// The pool is the crew's names, and the design asks for names that read as
// people rather than identifiers. It also says the pool is worth a content
// pass of its own once the mechanic is proven, which is the shape this
// list is written to: short enough for a log line, no repeats, and wide
// enough that a voyage never reaches the end of it. Every name is a single
// word so the sentences that carry one stay sentences.

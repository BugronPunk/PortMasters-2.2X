// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the voyage log
//
// [B4: the log surfaces] The room's own record of what happened on a
// voyage, as lines the server writes and every captain sitting in the
// room reads. It is the public half of the pair B4 asks for: the private
// half is the channel in src/lib/use-private-log.ts, which carries what
// the table is hiding and reaches one captain's sockets.
//
// The two halves are one idea told twice, and the difference is the
// audience rather than the shape. A public line goes to the room channel
// and names what the table already saw; a private entry goes to the
// captain it belongs to and is the only place a hidden thing travels.
//
// This module is the public half's vocabulary and nothing else: what a
// line can be about, and the sentence each fact becomes. It reads no
// clock, no socket and no database, the same shape ./phases.ts and
// ./standing.ts take and for the same reason, so the suite can hold every
// kind's line without a server, and so the one place that writes the
// lines is the one place that knows how they read.
//
// The text is written here rather than assembled on the client, which is
// the rule the private channel already follows: a surface prints what it
// was sent instead of building the same sentence out of fields, so a line
// cannot read one way on one screen and another way on the next.
// =====================================================================

// Every sentence below is read at the moment the line is built rather than
// stored, so a line the log hands a screen follows the language that screen
// prints in.

// What a line can be about. Every kind is a fact about the voyage that
// the whole table already knows: a line here is never the first place a
// captain learns something, which is what makes it safe to broadcast.
//
// A kind is added when a fact is worth reading at Dusk and not before. It
// is not a mirror of the telemetry spine's event list, and the two are
// deliberately not the same set: the spine measures a voyage for the
// operator, and this is read by the captains sailing it.

// reads cards at (see CARD_CONVERSION_FLOOR in ./cards, whose own
// comment records the alignment): one number for what counts as
// evidence, whichever instrument is doing the counting.
export const PAIR_APPEARANCE_FLOOR = 40;

// The balance target: the design's words are that a pair "stays under sixty
// two percent win rate", so a measurable pair at or above this share of
// its appearances has not stayed under and is a broken pair. The line is
// read inclusively for exactly that reason: thirty one wins out of fifty
// is the arithmetic a fifty appearance table actually writes, and it is
// the target that is missed, not the sample.
export const PAIR_WIN_CEILING = 0.62;

// The share of all wins a pair may appear in before the flag fires, the
// rule "more than a threshold share of wins". Authored here with its
// reasoning because the design leaves the number to the build: with
// roughly seventy cards in the pools, a pair appears in about one
// percent of wins under uniform play (a held set carries a handful of
// cards and each one pairs with every other), so a pair riding fifteen
// percent of wins is a pair present in one win in seven, an order of
// magnitude past chance. Raising it is a constant and nothing else, the
// same rollback the budget cap carries.

// The longest held set a column may carry, enforced at both ends: the
// finishers bound what they write with it (see the import in
// conclusion/finishers) and parseHeldCards bounds what it reads with it,
// so a hand written column cannot be longer than the record it imitates.
// The voyage itself bounds honest play far below this (a hull carries at
// most five modules, one charter, and a voyage's moments a handful of
// boons); this is headroom, not a limit.

// ========== The column ==========

/**
 * The held set a chronicle row carries, read back defensively.
 *
 * The column is JSON text written by the finishers, and this is the one
 * parse the report and any suite share so two readings of one column
 * cannot disagree. Anything that is not an array of strings reads as
 * empty, the reading the finishers give a save they could not trust, and
 * the list is deduped and bounded by the same constant the writer
 * bounded it with, because a row can also be written by hand.
 *
 * The ids are not resolved through the pool here. They are at counting
 * time instead (see readPairs), because the pool a row is read against
 * is the pool of the build doing the reading, which is the whole point:
 * a card retired after the row was written falls out of the matrix then,
 * not at some earlier parse.

 * other flag. Ordering puts the flagged rows first, then the measurable

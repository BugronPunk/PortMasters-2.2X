// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: reading the mode's win rates.
//
// The design's gate is a claim about numbers: an honest
// captain wins the share of voyages WIN_RATE_TARGETS records below, with a
// Broker's and a Pirate's bands beside it, and none of those rates moves
// when the table grows from four seats to five to six. Before this was
// recorded, nothing could check that, because a voyage concluded without
// recording who was dealt what. Now every finished voyage leaves its
// alignment and its verdict on a Chronicle row, so the claim is a query,
// and this module is the query: rows in, a reading of every band out.
//
// It is pure and it owns no database, the way ./victory.ts owns no socket:
// the reader below is arithmetic over rows, and the script that fetches
// them (scripts/bands.ts) is thin on purpose. One consequence worth naming
// is that a reading is never a measurement of the *players*, only of the
// voyages that happened to be played. A band with three voyages in it has a
// rate; it does not have evidence, and the report says so rather than
// rounding three voyages into a verdict.
//
// Bands are the deck's own (see ./objectives.ts): the reader walks the same
// table the rung scales quotas with, so a report can never group voyages by
// a table size the commission does not distinguish.
// =====================================================================

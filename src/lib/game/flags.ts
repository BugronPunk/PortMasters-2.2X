// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the epic's switches.
//
// [C4: three foods, spoilage and the split hold] The switch policy moved
// here out of ./larder when this epic's third and fourth families needed
// it. The policy itself is unchanged, down to the sentence: one reading
// function, one set of accepted values, one home. What changed is who
// reads it. When ./larder wrote it down, two switches read it, the layer
// itself and C2's loss rule. C3's wardrobe made three, C4's split hold
// made four, D2's path orders made five, D3's escort contracts made six,
// D4's refit made seven, D5's bazaar rumor made eight, D7's draft makes
// nine, F3's module trades make ten, F4's milestone boons make eleven and
// F6's charters make twelve, and a policy that twelve families depend on
// belongs beside none of them rather than inside the first one that
// needed it.
//
// [The mode boundary] Every switch here answers with two readings, and the
// order they are taken in is the rule: the mode first, the environment
// second.
//
// The systems this epic built are Ocean Gambit's, and Classic is the
// shipped release kept exactly as it was. That is a boundary rather than a
// default, so it is not the operator's to move: a deployment that exported
// NEXT_PUBLIC_BAZAAR=1 into a process serving both modes must not hand the
// bazaar to a Classic table, and the mode read is what stops it. The
// environment value is the switch the plan promises for each family, and it
// is read inside that boundary rather than beside it, so a switch can only
// ever take a system away from the mode it belongs to and never hand it to
// the one it does not.
//
// The mode read is folded in here rather than left at each call site for
// the reason the flag policy itself is here: thirty odd call sites writing
// two conditions is thirty odd chances to write them in the wrong order,
// and the order is the whole of the rule.
//
// Pure: no state, no clock, no socket. It touches the process environment
// and the mode record, and both of those are fixed for the life of the
// process: the environment because it is read from, and the record because
// it is a constant table rather than anything a voyage can move.

/**
 * The one place a survival switch is judged, for every flag in this epic.
 *
 * The policy is written here once because twelve switches read it now.
 * Nine are judged in this file, the provisions layer, C4's split hold,
 * D2's path orders, D3's escort contracts, D5's bazaar rumor, D7's draft,
 * F3's module trades, F4's milestone boons and F6's charters, and three
 * read it from their own module, C2's loss rule in ./crew, C3's wardrobe
 * in ./garments and D4's bench in ./engine/refits.
 * The cost of a copy apiece is a set that drifts: one flag accepting a
 * value another refuses is a bug that only shows the evening an operator
 * tries it.
 *
 * Unset, empty and any value that is not the word off or the digit zero
 * all mean the switch is on, matched after trimming and lowering, so a
 * typo leaves the game playable rather than quietly deleting a system.
 *
 * The value is passed in rather than the name, and that is the browser's
 * doing rather than a taste in signatures. The rules these switches gate
 * run where the engine runs, which is the browser, and a browser has no
 * environment to read: it is handed the values its bundle was built with,
 * and it is handed them by a substitution that only matches a read written
 * out in full at the place the read happens. A policy function that took a
 * name and looked it up would compile to a lookup on an empty object,
 * which reads as unset, which means on: every switch would answer yes in
 * every build, and the rollback notes in docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md would be
 * describing a mechanism that never engaged. Measured on the isolated copy
 * rather than reasoned about, which is how it was found. So the name
 * belongs at the call site and the policy belongs here, and the one rule
 * to remember when the next switch lands is that its read has to be written
 * out the same way: the name at the read, the judgement here.

 * src/server/realtime/checkpoint.ts). That one caches because it sits on a
 * path that runs a zod parse a leg and its value cannot move inside a
 * process; this is read a handful of times a leg, so a cache would buy
 * nothing, and leaving it live is what lets the suite hold both sides of
 * every switch in a single run rather than one process per value.

 * rather than left half applied." The two halves of that sentence are the
 * two halves of this switch, and each is read where the thing it disables
 * would happen.
 *
 * With the switch off no rumor can be published: the server refuses one
 * (see the bazaar handlers in src/server/realtime/wiring/bazaar.ts) and the
 * desk is not drawn at the Parley. And no band shift is applied, because
 * the two ends of the settlement read the same switch: the server sends no
 * lean on the advance that opens a market, and the engine folds none in
 * when it prices one (see startMarket in ./engine/market). That is what
 * "skipped cleanly rather than left half applied" costs, and it is the
 * same pair of reads the path orders already make.
 *
 * It is judged here rather than in ./engine/bazaar for the reason the
 * trailing note below gives about D4's bench read the other way around:
 * this feature stands on no other layer. A rumor is a rule about prices,
 * and prices are in the base game, so nothing has to be true of another
 * system before this one can answer.
 *
 * The plan's own words for this slice were that it "ships in the base mode,
 * not only in Ocean Gambit, and that is a deliberate call rather than an
 * oversight", and the call was reversed after the mode boundary was drawn:
 * a rumor is a system this branch added, and Classic is the shipped release
 * with nothing added to it, so the desk is Gambit's and the plan's sentence
 * is superseded rather than quietly outvoted. A rumor needs the mode read
 * like every other switch here, and the environment value is the rollback

/**

 * orders, because nothing before this feature ever wrote state.path. So
 * with the switch off the deal is not made (see the deal on room:start in

 * and the fleet sails the pathless voyage the D2 lock was written to be
 * true about: a pathless captain is locked out of every pathbound card,
 * which is a refusal the lock already answers without a single new rule.
 *
 * One switch covers the switch as well, and it is not an economy: a
 * captain changes the path they hold, and the only way to hold one is this
 * deal, so with the draft off the change has no precondition to meet and
 * pathSwitchBlocked says as much in its first sentence. There is no second
 * flag to write because there is no second state to roll back to.
 *
 * It is judged here rather than in ./draft because the rule module holds
 * no switch: ./engine/draft reads ./draft, and a switch read from there
 * would put the environment in a module whose whole point is that it is
 * pure. The read is written out in full at each call site, per the rule
 * flagOn's own comment states, and it has three: the deal on room:start,
 * the harbor's switch handler, and the panel that offers the voyage's one

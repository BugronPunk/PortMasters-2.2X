// =====================================================================
// [F4: boons at milestone moments] The five moments, read off the voyage
// and answered one card at a time.
//
// ./constants/milestones holds the vocabulary: the five triggers and the
// words a captain meets when one arrives. This module is the walk, the
// same split F1 took with the tags and F2 with the card shape. What it
// walks is two fields on the state (see the field notes in ./types):
//
//   - milestoneOffers is the queue of moments waiting to be answered.
//     A queue rather than a phase, because the five moments land at
//     three different seats of the lap and a phase would have to be
//     entered again from each of them; an offer is a local act, answered
//     where the captain stands, with no ready vote and no phase gate.
//     Nothing here takes an offer off the queue: that is ./engine's
//     answerMilestone, which is the only writer the queue has.
//
//   - milestonesAnswered carries the mark each trigger is answered to,
//     in that trigger's own units, so a moment that can honestly happen
//     twice is answered twice and one that cannot stays answered. The
//     units are: crew loss counts the losses answered, the pathbound
//     order and the mandate are latches, the rung counts rungs, and the
//     cold leg carries the round it was answered in.
//
// The cards those moments hand out are held cards, and their half of the
// story (the ids a captain carries and the flags they write) lives in
// ./held-cards, beside the heal that keeps a stale save honest.
//
// Everything below is a pure read of those fields and the rest of the
// state. Nothing here mutates and no clock is read; the one environment
// read is the switch, which lives in ./flags with the rest of its family.

 * second spelling of the same save, and the two spellings would compare

// ========== The offer ==========

/**
 * The cards a moment puts in front of a captain.
 *
 * Derived rather than stored, and seeded rather than rolled, for two
 * reasons. A queue can hold two moments at once and the first one's
 * answer can change what the second one should offer (a card taken is a
 * card no longer offered), so the honest set is the one derived at the
 * moment it is shown. And the seed leaves the round out on purpose: a
 * room advance, a checkpoint, a reload and a host start can all land
 * between the offer being armed and the captain answering, and none of
 * them may reshuffle the three cards under a captain's eyes. The
 * trigger's own card is anchored first, because the moment and the card
 * written for it are one sentence; the rest are a weighted draw from the
 * pool this moment's family shares, through F2's own draw, so a card
 * taken from one moment is never offered at the next (held ids are out
 * of the pool) and the pool running dry is answered by the caller rather
 * than here.
 *
 * The mark rides in the seed so that a trigger which fires twice deals a
 * second distinct hand where the shrinking pool allows one, which is
 * what the plan's own cadence asks of a repeat.
 *
 * [F7: the power budget] The budget filters the table after the draw
 * rather than before it, and that placement is load bearing: this reader
 * is derived again on every render, a peer can settle a trade onto this
 * captain's hull while a moment is queued, and a filter inside the draw
 * would hand the same seed a different pool the moment power moved, which
 * is the reshuffle the paragraph above forbids. Filtering the drawn trio
 * keeps the draw blind to power, so a power drop can only put a card back on
 * a table the captain is looking at, never take one away, and a click
 * already made can never be invalidated. What the filter can leave is an
 * empty table for a captain whose hull is too heavy, which every caller
 * already answers: the head of the queue is left inert rather than drawn
 * as a screen with no exit (see milestonePending), and the arm path tells
 * its two empties apart so the cap defers a moment rather than spending
 * it (see queueMilestoneMoment). The ignoreBudget arm is the arm path's
 * own question ("is the family's pool dry, the budget aside") and is not
 * a second reading of the table: same seed, same pool, the one filter
 * lifted.

/**
 * Whether a moment is waiting to be answered on this captain's screen.
 *
 * Three readings and every one is load bearing. The queue has to be non
 * empty, because that is what a moment waiting means. The switch has to be
 * on, because the plan's rollback is "boons are additive and rare, so a
 * content revert is clean": with the switch off no moment is queued (the
 * arming path reads the same switch, see ./engine/milestones), a queue
 * left over from a save written while it was on is simply not drawn, and
 * the boons already held keep their effects for the voyage, which is
 * F3's reading of an off switch rather than a new one: the data stays,
 * the moment does not arrive. The save's own healing is the unwinding
 * path either way (see normalizeHeldBoons in ./held-cards).
 *
 * And the head of the queue has to still have a card on its table. The
 * arm path spends a moment whose pool has run dry rather than queueing
 * it (see queueMilestoneMoment), but a moment queued while it still had
 * a table can lose that table before a captain reaches it: a moment
 * waiting behind another can see its last available card taken by the
 * answer ahead of it. Reading the pool at the head is enough because the
 * five moments share one, so an empty table at the head is an empty
 * table everywhere. [F7: the power budget] One exception rides on the
 * budget and it is the safe direction: a table emptied by the cap can
 * refill if the captain's power later drops, because a module sold or
 * swapped down frees weight (see powerBudgetAllows in ./held-cards), so
 * the reading is no longer strictly monotone. What it keeps is the
 * property that matters: the moment is left inert on the queue while the
 * table is empty, never spent and never drawn as a screen with no exit,
 * and it either revives when the hull lightens or stays quietly queued.

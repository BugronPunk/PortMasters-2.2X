// The escort contract: one captain sells another a round of protection.
//
// The board itself is harbor state (src/server/realtime/contracts); what
// lives here is the reading. applyEscortSide applies each captain's side to
// their own state and nobody else's, the model this codebase follows for
// cross captain money. escortCoverOf is a mirror of the board, not a copy:
// it answers null the moment the contract leaves the board.
//
// Fees, expiry, the offer bounds and the settlement ledger belong to the
// consent primitive (see ./consent). The fee does not feed
// peerTradeProfit in ./barter; an escort premium is a different
// institution, and the contract's own tally counts its coin.

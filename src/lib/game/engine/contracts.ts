// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the escort contract.
//
// [D3: Convoy: the Escort Contract] One captain sells another a single leg
// of protection at a price they both agree, and this module is everything
// the agreement means on a captain's own machine. The board itself is room
// state (src/server/realtime/contracts), because an agreement between two
// captains is an object no single client can be the authority over; what
// lives here is the reading of it, in three parts.
//
// The first part is who may sell, which is one line and one reading of the
// path record: a captain holding the Convoy path sells protection, the
// same way D2 reads a locked order off the good it demands rather than off
// a label written on a card. Nothing in this module names the path twice.
//
// The second part is what the contract does to a purse, and it is one
// function, applyEscortSide, because a contract has two sides and both of
// them run the same code: the fee moves when the two captains agree (the
// plan's "contracts pay first"), and the absorbed raid moves when the
// covered captain reports one, and each movement is applied by each
// captain to their own state and to nobody else's. That is the tree's
// standing model for cross captain money, the same one bartering and loans
// run on (see ./barter and ./aid): the server brokers the agreement and
// relays the claim, and a purse is only ever touched by its owner.
//
// The third part is the cover the raid roll consults, which is a mirror of
// the board rather than a copy of it: escortCoverOf answers null the
// moment the contract leaves the board, so a seller who walked out takes
// their guns with them rather than leaving a promise behind.
//
// Everything else an agreement is made of is not this module's any more.
// What a fee may be, which rows a captain sees, when an offer expires, the
// one offer per seller per buyer bound, the accept that sweeps the rest,
// and the ledger that keeps a reload from moving the same Gold twice are
// the consent primitive D4's refit shares (see ./consent), and the server
// reads them from there rather than through a second name here.
//
// Two things are deliberately outside this module's reach and worth saying
// here so the next reader does not go looking for them. The fee does not
// reach peerTradeProfit in ./barter, because that ledger is the barter
// ledger by the plan's own account of the Broker, and an escort premium is
// a different institution; the contract's own tally is where its coin is
// counted. And nothing here is persisted: the plan asks for contracts to
// be transient room state, so the only thing a save carries is the tally
// of what already happened and the ledger of movements already applied,
// both of which are records rather than agreements.

 * the price was agreed in the open. A refusal was not, and it is the one
 * row that would hand the table what a private offer is for, since a
 * seller asked one captain a price and that captain said no. The row is
 * kept rather than deleted so the seller reads what came back instead of
 * reading nothing (see the withdrawn note in src/server/realtime/wiring/
 * escort-contracts.ts), and it is kept for the two captains it names,
 * which is the shape the aimed offer had in the first place.
 *
 * The second is the one field the escort carries that is not public:
 * `raidGold` is the covered captain's own report of what a raid would have
 * taken, and it is on the board for one reader, the seller, who is the
 * captain the number turns into a bill. Everyone else, the buyer included,
 * reads the row without it. That is a filtering rule rather than a field
 * the wire leaves out, so a client that asked for the board directly reads
 * the same row the broadcast carried.

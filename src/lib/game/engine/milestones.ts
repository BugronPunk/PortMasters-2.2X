// =====================================================================
// [F4: boons at milestone moments] The three state changes the five
// moments need: arming one, answering one, and the two sweeps that
// notice the moments the voyage itself produces.
//
// The pure half is ../milestones (what is due, what a moment offers) and
// ../held-cards (what is held). This half is the writes, and there are
// exactly three:
//
//   - queueMilestoneMoment arms one moment. The switch, the queue guard,
//     the due gate, the tally and the ledger line all live here so the
//     five trigger sites are one call each and none of them carries a
//     copy of the order those readings are taken in. A moment whose pool
//     has nothing left to offer is marked answered instead of queued,
//     because there is no decline and every card is a gain: an offer
//     with an empty table would be a screen with no exit.
//
//   - answerMilestone takes one card off the head of the queue. It is
//     the only writer the queue, the held list and the marks have, and
//     it validates against the same derived choices the screen drew (see
//     milestoneChoices), so a stale click or a hand made frame is
//     refused rather than trusted.
//
//   - The two sweeps are where the moments the voyage produces on its
//     own are noticed. The crew loss is written by the dawn meal, so its
//     sweep runs at dawn beside the meal; the cold leg and the rung are
//     both facts the settlement produces (the tick's stamps and the
//     settled books), so their sweep runs at the settlement's end. The
//     three site moments (the pathbound order, the mandate) arm where
//     their events happen rather than in a sweep.
//
// Every path into here is idempotent, which matters because every one of
// them can be entered twice: the dawn and the settlement both run again
// when a captain catches up to the room (the same second entry the ticks'
// own round stamps exist for), the queue guard keeps a waiting moment
// from being armed again, and the marks only move forward, so the worst
// a second entry does is arm the next unanswered moment of a repeatable
// trigger when its terms already hold.

 * Arms one moment, if the voyage is running them and this one is due.

 * The order the readings are taken in is the order they are written: the
 * switch first, because with it off a moment costs nothing to refuse; the
 * queue guard second, because a moment already waiting is the same
 * moment and arming it twice would put one event in front of a captain
 * as two; the due gate third, which is the pure half's five arms; and
 * the offer last, because drawing cards is the only work here.
 *
 * The tally is written at the arm rather than at the screen, because the
 * screen renders again (a socket frame, a phase tick) and an offer count
 * has to count offers. The choices are derived by the same call the
 * screen will make, so the cards counted are exactly the cards dealt.

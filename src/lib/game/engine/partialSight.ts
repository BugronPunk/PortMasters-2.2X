// =====================================================================
// Partial sight.
//
// In multiplayer, the harbor knows things about other captains that a
// given captain should only partly see, depending on how established both
// of them are. A Deckhand looking at a Silk Road Legend sees the headline
// numbers (Renown level, title) but not the detail (current Gold, current
// cargo); two Trade Officers looking at each other see the detail too.
// This module owns the two small helpers that draw that line, kept here
// so the rest of the engine never has to reason about visibility rules.
//
// Two thresholds, answering two different questions: the viewer has to be
// established enough to be trusted with detail (Renown Level 5, a Trade
// Officer), and the captain being looked at has to have enough of a
// record for that detail to say anything (Renown Level 3, an Able
// Seaman). Below either line, only the headline numbers show.
//
// This reads a captain's Renown and nothing else it might have been
// aligned with. An earlier version of this comment claimed it mirrored a
// trust gate on Backing, a gate that has never existed: lending and
// backing are open to every captain whatever their Renown.

// a missing field; the other bands widen deliberately so a viewer can
// tell "a few" from "a haul" without learning the precise number.
//
// Each band is read at the return, because these are the engine's own
// words and the peek only ever prints the answer: no caller compares one
// band against another, so the value can travel already spoken.

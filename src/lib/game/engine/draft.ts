// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the draft's writes into a save.
//
// [D7: the draft, and switching] The engine half of the plan's clause. The
// rule half (the deck, the pass, the window and the fee) lives in
// ../draft and holds no state; this module is what a kept card and a
// changed identity write into a captain's own save.
//
// The engine writes a path twice, and both writes are the captain's own:
// applyDraftPath, for the card the draft's last step leaves them holding,
// and applyPathSwitch, for the one time a voyage they set it aside. The
// only other hand on either field is the load heal, which repairs a save
// rather than deciding anything (see use-game-session.ts). The server deals
// the cards and publishes a switch to the fleet (see
// src/server/realtime/draft), and neither of those writes a save, which is
// the line the bazaar's desk draws about the same subject: the path a
// captain holds lives in their own save and this server has never read
// one.
//
// pathSwitchBlocked is the one reader the panel and the switch itself
// share: a control the harbor greys out and a press the engine refuses
// are the same sentence, because they are the same function. It answers
// with the reason rather than a bare no, the way orderShortfall answers
// with the good, since the reason is the only part of a refusal worth
// printing.

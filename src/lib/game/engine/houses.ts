// =====================================================================
// Great Houses.
//
// A captain's chosen House is a persistent, account level identity that
// colours a voyage without unbalancing it. Each House grants one small,
// thematic perk at the start of every fresh voyage and nothing else: no
// monthly fee, no gating, no perk that scales with Renown. The point is a
// flavourful leaning rather than a power pick, which is why every perk is
// either a one shot discount or a flat per round nudge rather than a
// multiplier on the things that compound.
//
// The three Houses map onto the three cornerstones of the voyage loop:
// Jade Pavilion rewards craft (the artisan economy), Vermilion Gate
// rewards trade (the market and cargo economy), Golden Lotus rewards risk
// (the wager economy). Captains can switch Houses between voyages from
// the Lobby; applyHousePerkAtStart runs on the next fresh start, never
// mid voyage.
//
// HouseId lives in ../legacy.ts so both the persistence layer (which
// writes the chosen House onto the CaptainLegacy row) and this module
// can read it without one importing the other. The list of them comes
// with it, so the table below is written against the list rather than
// beside it.

// the empty set has one definition: a field added here and forgotten in a
// hand written copy elsewhere is a crash waiting on the first captain to
// load a save from before that field, which is exactly the trap the save
// normaliser in use-game-session.ts would otherwise have to dodge by hand.

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: what a captain's standing orders
// actually do.
//
// [B3: standing orders] The record, the vocabulary and the normalizer
// live in ../standing. This is the half that touches the voyage: the two
// readings ./lifecycle's autoCommit takes before it plays a seat the
// captain was not standing at.
//
// The governing rule, and the reason every branch below calls the same
// exported engine function a button would: **an order can do nothing a
// captain could not have done by hand.** Nothing here sets a price,
// moves a good or credits a coin itself. It chooses between the actions
// the seat already offers, and the seat's own guards decide the rest, so
// a purse that cannot afford a card and a hold that cannot cover an order
// refuse an order exactly as they refuse a click.
//
// The two functions are split the way the engine already splits this
// question. Which boon to take is a *choice*, and the departure that
// follows a choice is the spine's (see lockInBoon); the other three
// seats' work happens before a departure that would have happened anyway.
// That is the same split selectBoon and lockInBoon already use, one
// module over.
//
// Not the trade board: the orders a captain fills at the Orders phase
// live in ./orders. These are the standing ones, the captain's written
// instructions.

/**
 * The boon a captain's orders ask for, resolved against the board they
 * were actually dealt, or null when the orders ask for nothing or ask
 * for a boon this round did not offer.
 *
 * The board check is the whole reason this is a function rather than a
 * field read. selectBoon accepts any id in the catalogue, which is right
 * for a panel that can only draw from the three cards on screen, and
 * wrong for a written instruction that could name a boon the captain was
 * never dealt. An order that named one would be a captain taking a card
 * off a board they were not shown, so a miss falls back to the engine's
 * own default rather than reaching for the catalogue.

/**
 * The seat's work, done the way the captain wrote it, for the three seats
 * whose work is a set of presses rather than the departure itself.
 *
 * It does nothing for every other phase, and that is not an omission: Parley's
 * work happens over the offer board rather than in the engine, so there
 * is no pure path for an instruction to take (a gap ../standing's header
 * names), the module draft rolls a fresh board every round so there is
 * nothing honest to write about it ahead of time, and Resolve and the
 * pier offer no choice at all.
 *
 * The receipts at the end of the three branches are the log's half of the
 * feature. A captain who comes back to a voyage their orders played finds
 * the engine's own lines ("Bought at ...", "Completed Order at ...")
 * indistinguishable from their own clicks, so the seat says, once and
 * after the fact, that nobody was standing there.

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the module trade.
//
// [F3: modules in the shipyard ladder, and trading them between captains]
// The shipyard has climbed the same ladder since the first voyage: a hull
// takes one more module for every level it gains, up to three at ship
// level three (the top of the climb, see MAX_SHIP_LEVEL in
// ../constants/ships), and a module bolted on is permanent until
// a swap at the yard takes it off (see moduleSlotsOpen in ./core and
// equipModule in ./boons). What the ladder never had is a way for a module
// to leave the hull it was drafted into and join another. That is the whole
// of this feature: one captain lists a module they have bolted on, another
// buys it at a price the two of them agree, and the module changes hands at
// the Parley table, which gives the build layer its own liquidity and gives
// the table a class of deal that is not about commodities.
//
// The agreement is the consent primitive D3's escort contract and D4's
// refit already share (see ./consent), which is why this module is as short
// as it is: what a fee is, which rows a captain sees, when an offer
// expires, the one offer per seller per buyer bound, the accept that sweeps
// the rest and the ledger that keeps a reload from moving the same Gold
// twice are read from there rather than written again. What is kind
// specific, and therefore here:
//
// Who may sell. Anyone, which is this kind's departure from its two
// siblings and not an omission. The escort's seller is a Convoy and the
// bench's is a Loom, because cover and mending are path abilities; a module
// is not an ability, it is a thing bolted to a hull, so a captain's only
// qualification is owning one. The server cannot read a save and does not
// try (the trust boundary every consent board holds, restated in
// src/server/realtime/consent), so a listing is a captain's own claim about
// their own hull, and the seller's own client is what takes the module off.
//
// What the two captains are trading. A module card id, checked against the
// pool through isModuleId below, which is the reader the server's post
// handler asks before it publishes a row, so a row naming a boon or a card
// nobody can bolt on never reaches a board.
//
// What an agreement does to a state, which is the plan's own named rule:
// "Trading a slotted module needs a rule about what happens if it is traded
// while equipped, and the answer should be an automatic unequip rather than
// a block." So the seller's side of a settle takes the module out of
// equippedModules and unwinds the accounting two modules carry for as long
// as they are installed (see unequipModuleAccounting in ./boons), then
// credits the agreed fee; the buyer's side pays what their purse holds and
// bolts the module on.
//
// Which side is bounded to one agreement a leg. Neither, and this is the
// other place the kind parts company with its siblings. The escort bounds
// its buyer because one captain's cover is one field and a second contract
// could not be honoured; the bench bounds its seller because one Loom has
// two hands and one leg. A hull's modules are a shelf rather than a field
// and not a pair of hands: what bounds a sale is that one module can only
// leave once, which is the per module lock below, and what bounds a
// purchase is the buyer's own slot count, read on the buyer's own panel
// rather than counted by the room. Neither is a rule the server can check,
// and the server does not pretend to: it keeps the ordering (one row per
// module per seller per leg, one open offer per seller per buyer) and
// leaves the hulls to their owners.
//
// One corner the buyer's side is written around, worth saying because a
// reader will look for the missing check and should find this instead. A
// purchase settling onto a hull whose slots are all full bolts the module
// on anyway rather than refusing it or dropping it. The panel hides the
// accept where there is no room and the honest path cannot reach the
// corner (both sides settle within a tick of the accept, in the Parley,
// and the yard only opens at Dusk), but the two machines have to reach the
// same answer about whether a trade happened without being able to see each
// other's hulls, and the one answer both can reach is that an agreed trade
// always completes. A module lost between two clients would be a durable
// thing destroyed by a race, which is the outcome the plan's rollback
// clause treats as the thing not to do ("keep the table and disable
// equipping, rather than dropping the table and losing equipped modules");
// a hull reading one over its slots is a captain who swaps at the yard
// before drafting again, which the yard's screens already carry, because
// every slot reader floors at zero and answers "full" (see moduleSlotsOpen
// in ./core).

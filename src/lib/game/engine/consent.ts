// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the consent primitive.
//
// [D4: Loom: the Refit] D3's escort contract and D4's refit are the same
// transaction twice: one captain offers a service at a price, another
// captain accepts it, and each side then moves its own purse. The plan asks
// for one of these rather than two ("the two features share one consent
// primitive rather than growing two"), so this module is the shape itself
// and ./contracts and ./refits are the two things it is about.
//
// What is shared is the whole of the agreement's mechanics: what a fee is,
// which rows a captain sees, when an offer stops being one, what a second
// offer from one seller to one buyer means, what an accept sweeps off the
// board, and the ledger that keeps a reload from moving the same Gold
// twice. None of it names an escort or a refit, a raid or a garment, so a
// third agreement is a third binding rather than a third copy of this file.
//
// What is deliberately not shared is the four things that differ, and each
// one lives with its own kind: who may sell, what the two captains are
// trading (a leg of cover, a garment put right), what an agreement does to
// a state, and which side is bounded to one agreement a leg. A primitive
// that took those as parameters would be a thing every caller has to read
// before it can be used, which is the cost this module exists to avoid.
//
// It reads no switch. The rollback belongs to the kind, because a build
// with the escort off but the refit on is an ordinary build and the two
// switches answer for their own rows (see escortContractsOn in ../flags).

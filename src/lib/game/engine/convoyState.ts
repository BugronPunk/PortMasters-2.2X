// CONVOY_VENTURE_FAILURE_REFUND_RATE of what they originally put in, their
// own venture ran out its own deadline round short of target), or
// "destroyed" (amount is their full original contribution back, untouched:
// a different venture in the same harbor reached its target first and
// claimed this voyage's one shared chance, so this one never got to run its
// own course and nobody who backed it is penalized for that). Only one
// venture can ever end "filled" in a single voyage; see venture:post and
// venture:contribute in src/server/realtime/wiring/ventures.ts for where
// that's enforced.

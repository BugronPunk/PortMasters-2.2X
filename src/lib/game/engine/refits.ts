// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Loom's refit.
//
// [D4: Loom: the Refit] The plan hands this path three things and they are
// one trade read from three ends. A Loom captain puts another captain's
// garment right, faster and cheaper than that captain could manage alone.
// The same captain holds the crafting chain, which is the reweave: the
// harbor's pile of rags turns back into clothes in their hands and in
// nobody else's. And the same captain is the only one who may buy that
// pile, which is what makes the first two worth holding.
//
// The refit is the first cross captain mutation in this tree's engine, so
// the authorization question is the one this module is built around, and
// the answer is the plan's own: a mutual acceptance, on the primitive D3's
// escort contract already uses (see ./consent). The Loom offers, the
// customer accepts, and what actually changes the customer's clothes is
// the customer's own client running the same function the mend runs. No
// captain's state is ever written by another captain's machine, which is
// the rule every cross captain movement in this tree follows: the server
// brokers the agreement and the owner applies it.
//
// What is kind specific, and therefore here: the seller is the Loom, the
// term is a good rather than a leg of cover, the effect puts points back
// into a garment, the seller is bounded to one refit a leg because one
// captain can only put one garment right in a leg, and the harbor's own
// pile and its mend are the baseline the refit is priced against.

 *
 * It is judged here rather than in ./flags for the reason that module's

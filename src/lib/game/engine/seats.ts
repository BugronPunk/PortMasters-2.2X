// =====================================================================
// [H7: Maroon and the Harbormaster] What happens to a seat that fails.
//
// Two ways to fail a voyage stop a captain from winning it, and this is
// the one place either of them is applied. The harbor votes a captain
// ashore, or the captain's own books put them in front of the harbor with
// nothing to pay the bills with.
//
// What the two share is that neither of them removes the seat, which is
// the pillar the mode is built on rather than a mercy: a table that can
// shrink is a table where the last two rounds are played by fewer people
// than the first, and the whole design of Ocean Gambit is what a harbor
// does with a captain it can see and does not trust. A bankrupt captain
// still holds a card, still votes, still trades at the table and still
// answers the audit's questions. A marooned captain keeps all of that and
// is handed the harbor's own lever on top.
//
// The two differ in what is taken. Bankruptcy takes nothing: the bills
// took it already, that is what bankruptcy means, and the mode's honest
// reading of it is a captain who sails on with a different card to play
// (see ModeConfig.bankruptcyIsFinal for why Classic does not get this).
// Marooning is a decision somebody made, so it costs the captain their
// ship and everything on it, half their Gold, and nothing else: not their
// crew, not their standing at the table, and not their card.
//
// Engine module rather than one of the pure ones beside it: every
// function here mutates a GameState, which is the line ./market,
// ./workers and ./lifecycle all sit on the same side of. The number that
// decides how much Gold survives is not here, it is in ../maroon.

// Who may barter flexibly, and how often.
//
// Two surfaces reach the offer board and they are not held to the same
// rule. The Captain's Exchange, the board the Parley draws, is
// the standing way to trade: it is open to every captain from their
// first voyage and nothing in this module touches it. Flexible bartering
// is the extra, the composer a chat carries, which puts a swap in front
// of one captain or the whole harbor at any point in a voyage whether or
// not the board is on screen. That one is earned, and this module is its
// whole policy.
//
// Everything here takes a Renown Level as a plain number and imports
// nothing but constants, so the identical functions run on a client
// deciding whether to draw a button and on the server deciding whether to
// honour the click.
//
// An unknown level is always passed in as a number that fails, never left
// undefined. The roster on the wire carries a captain whose client never
// reported a level as unknown rather than as a confident zero (see the
// renownLevel fallthrough in
// src/server/realtime/wiring/status-heartbeat.ts), so every caller has to
// turn that unknown into a number before it reaches this module, and the
// only safe direction to round is down.

// a captain may have standing at once, which is what lets them advertise
// the same intent in several places and take whichever answer arrives

// accepting is never asked about theirs.

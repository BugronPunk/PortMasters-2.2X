// Every "what does this cost" question the game asks: freight, VAT,
// income tax, the price of a market card, the wage of an artisan, and the
// Broker's cut on a favor.
//
// Everything here is a pure function of state plus its arguments. Nothing
// in this file writes to GameState, pushes a log line, or draws from the
// RNG, which is what makes it the safest part of the engine to reason
// about and the natural first real subsystem to stand on its own.
//
// The explain* functions are deliberate duplicates of their calc*
// counterparts rather than the calc* functions delegating to them. That
// keeps the balance critical math, ported verbatim from the original
// single player build, from ever having to change shape to accommodate a
// tooltip. The cost of that choice is that a balance change has to be made
// in two places; the benefit is that a tooltip bug can never become a
// pricing bug.
//
// The card price is the one exception, and the header would be lying if it
// did not say so: explainCardPrice is the real thing, and getCardFinalCost
// reads the final step off it. The two were never independent. A card's
// price is short enough that the breakdown *is* the calculation, so
// splitting them would mean copying the whole body to buy a separation
// that had already gone, and a second copy is where a drift would start.

// in this game (see hireWorker, which never touches state.money);

// worker, so every place that shows or charges a wage, this function,
// payWages, and the Pending Payroll preview in phases/WorkerMgmt.tsx,
// must all read from here rather than derive the formula again themselves.
// Root cause of the Master's Apprentice bug: payWages and that preview
// used to hardcode WAGES[type] with only the Artisan's Workshop
// surcharge, so hire_discount silently never reduced the actual wage
// payment even though the hiring screen's own price looked discounted.

// ========== Broker intel ==========
// The Gold a captain pays for one Broker's rumor in Market. Used to live
// directly on GameState as `intelCost`, set to 5 by createInitialGameState
// and toggled to 2 by the Broker's Network module's equip/unequip hooks in
// ./boons.ts. Derived here now instead, so the cost can never drift out of
// sync with whether the module is actually equipped: the field is gone from
// the state, and the answer is read straight off hasModule, the same way
// the rest of this file derives a price from any other module flag.
//
// Callers (purchaseIntel in ./orders.ts and the Broker UI in GamePhasePanel)
// should call this rather than reading state.intelCost, which no longer
// exists. Reading it once per purchase keeps the Brokers Network module's
// discount live the instant it is equipped, with no separate state write
// needed to keep the field current.
// The two prices of one rumor, named rather than left inline: the guide
// states the first to every captain, and a second copy of either number
// would be the one that went stale. The discounted price is read only by
// the reader just below, so it is not exported.

// ========== Broker's Favor ==========
// The Broker's cut on a Broker's Favor order, a saturating curve rather
// than a flat rate. Net payout climbs almost one for one with reward at
// first (a small order keeps the feel of a low flat rate) but bends hard as
// reward grows, approaching the cap in force without ever reaching it. That
// gives callBrokersFavor a hard ceiling on what a single favor can pay out
// regardless of how large a quantity a captain asks for, instead of needing
// to cap the quantity itself. The cap is the Age's, not a fixed constant:
// see brokersFavorPayoutCap.
export function brokersFavorCommission(reward: number): number {
  // The cap comes from the Age in force, not straight off the constant, so
  // the Broker's Age genuinely lets one favor pay out more than usual (see
  // brokersFavorPayoutCap). Reading it here rather than at the call sites
  // keeps the Orders panel, the action suggester's net figure and the
  // payout itself all quoting the same number.

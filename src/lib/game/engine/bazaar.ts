// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the bazaar rumor.
//
// [D5: Aroma: the Bazaar Rumor] The plan hands this path one action, and
// it is the only lie this game invites a captain to tell in the open.
// Once every three legs an Aroma captain speaks at the bazaar: the next
// port's price band moves for one commodity, and the fleet is told who
// spoke and which good they named. Which way they leaned it is theirs
// until the market it moves has already been priced.
//
// That last sentence is the whole feature, so it is worth the lines it
// takes. The plan's argument for it is the best one in the base game:
// this is "a deception primitive an ordinary honest player can use",
// which "teaches every player that public information can be weaponized",
// and which means "a suspicious price movement is never automatic
// evidence of a traitor". Every one of those three depends on the rumor
// being published in the open rather than whispered. A whisper would be
// the traitor's move, and the point of the design is that the honest
// captain has a move of the same shape: what the table cannot tell apart
// is a lie told to move a price and a call made in good faith, so a price
// move stops being a confession.
//
// What is here: the cooldown, the visibility rule, the lean itself, and
// the order of the three. What is not here: the room's board, which lives
// beside the socket that speaks on it (see src/server/realtime/bazaar.ts),
// and the copy, which is written where it is printed.
//
// Pure: no socket, no database, no clock. Every reader takes its rows and
// its leg as arguments, which is what lets the suite hold the whole rule
// without opening a server, and the one switch this feature reads is
// judged in ./flags where the epic keeps that policy.

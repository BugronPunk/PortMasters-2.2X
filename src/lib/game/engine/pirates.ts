// The one risk Resolve turns on: whether raiders find the
// hold this round, and the escort a captain can buy to rule that out.
//
// Both are resolved by the same one shot latch, state.pirateAttackResolved,
// which is why they belong together. Whichever runs first closes the
// round's waters, so hiring an escort after the roll is refused and rolling
// again after an escort cannot happen.
//
// [D3: Convoy: the Escort Contract] There are three ways a raid can meet a
// captain now rather than two, and the third is the one this feature added:
// a raider can find a hold covered by a contract sold to its owner. The
// roll itself is untouched, since a contract does not change the odds of a
// raid arriving, only what the raid takes when it does; the branch below is
// read after the roll and before the Gold moves, which is the only place
// the two answers about one raid can be told apart.
//
// The covered branch does not pay the seller here, and the reason is worth
// the sentence. This module runs on the captain the raiders found, and the
// seller is another machine: what this client can do is keep its own Gold
// and leave a claim behind (state.pendingEscortClaim) for the React layer
// to relay to the harbor, which is the same division of labour the whole
// contract runs on (see ./contracts). The claim carries the Gold the raid
// would have taken, because the seller is the one who prices what they eat.

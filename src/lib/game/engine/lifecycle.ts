// The voyage's spine: what happens at the end of a round, how the phases
// chain into one another, and how a voyage begins, concludes and restarts.
//
// Everything here is orchestration. Each function's job is to call into
// the subsystems in the right order and move state.phase along, which is
// why this module imports from nearly every sibling and none of them
// import back. That one way flow is deliberate: the subsystems stay
// independently testable, and the sequencing lives in exactly one place.
//
// nextPhase and snapToCheckpoint are the two dispatch tables. The first
// advances a captain one step from wherever they are; the second drops a
// captain straight onto a given round and phase, which is what lets
// someone joining a room mid voyage land where everyone else already is
// rather than back at round 1.
//
// Where nextPhase steps TO is not written here. It comes from the room's
// mode, through the lap in ./mode.ts, so the same engine runs a different
// leg for a different voyage without a single branch on which mode it is.
// Every departure below does its own content work and names no successor;
// the handoff at the bottom of nextPhase is the only thing that decides
// where a phase leads, and it asks the lap.

// The words come from the phase's own face in ../phases, which is the single
// place a phase is described, so the status panel, the voyage rail and the
// log headers all say the same thing about the same phase. A phase of the leg
// is qualified by the round it is in, because "Resolve" alone does not tell a
// captain how far along the voyage they are; the pier and the phases that are
// not steps of the leg (drafting a module, the two terminals) read as
// themselves, since none of them is a station a round passes through.

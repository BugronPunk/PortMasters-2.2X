// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Free Captain's borrow.
//
// [D6: Free Captain: Opportunist] The plan hands this path the honest
// version of what the paywall was reaching for. Once a voyage, a Free
// Captain fills any one pathbound order without joining its path, at a
// forty percent payout penalty. The plan says why that is the right shape
// and it is worth keeping where the rule lives: the locked card stays
// tantalizing, it stays reachable, and the reach costs something real,
// while the cost is zero dollars. What the captain spends is a once a
// voyage allowance and a fifth of their payout on that one order, and a
// price that is not money is the whole reason the plan calls it honest.
//
// [F6: charters at leg four] The Factor is the borrow's second door. The
// plan's trio offers the charter to a Free Captain among their own pair,
// and every other path can draw it as its wildcard, and its text sells
// the borrow itself to whoever holds it: "Borrowing is open three times a
// voyage, and each borrow carries a 60% penalty." A charter the four
// other paths could take and gain nothing from would be a trap inside a
// trio, which is the dishonesty the plan's own Letter of Marque note
// warns about, so the charter opens the door to its holder and the
// readers below answer in its terms: the allowance becomes the charter's
// count rather than the path's one, the penalty becomes the charter's
// rate, and the borrow's lead names the door it came through. The Free
// Captain who takes it trades up in open doors and down in price, which
// is the same trade every other taker makes, and none of it writes a
// second field: the charter is one id on the state, and everything here
// is a reading of it.
//
// What is here: the allowance, who may spend it (the path, or the charter
// that buys the door), what the payout becomes, the one line the board
// and the ledger both print, and the healing. What is not here: the order
// it is spent on. That is the order board's, and this module deliberately
// does not import it (see the note on the lock below), so the rule can be
// read without the board and the board can read the rule without a cycle.
//
// Pure: no socket, no database, no clock. The one switch this feature
// reads is the one its locked cards already read, and it is judged in
// ./flags, which is where the epic keeps that policy.

/**

 * The switch is read first and separately from the door, the reading every

 * rollback and the door is the captain's own, and a build with the feature
 * off must refuse a Free Captain as flatly as it refuses everyone else.
 * The rollback is D2's own switch, which is deliberate rather than a
 * shortcut: this ability exists only where a locked order does, so taking
 * the locks off the board (see pathOrdersOn) takes the borrow with them
 * and leaves nothing durable behind, exactly as the plan's rollback clause
 * asks.
 *
 * The door itself is opportunistIsBorrower's answer and not a comparison
 * written here, because [F6: charters at leg four] gave the ability a
 * second way in: the Factor's holder borrows without holding the path,
 * and the board's spent line asks the same question of the same reader.
 *
 * The lock is taken as an argument rather than looked up here, and that is
 * what keeps this module and ./engine/orders from importing each other:
 * the caller already holds the engine's own answer (lockedBehind) and
 * passes it in, so there is one reading of which path a card waits on and
 * no second copy of it. A null lock is not this captain's to borrow,
 * because it is not locked to them at all.
 *
 * The flag read is written out in full at this line rather than passed by
 * name, which is the browser's rule and not a taste in signatures: a
 * bundle is handed the values it was built with by a substitution that
 * only matches a read written where it happens (see flagOnFor).

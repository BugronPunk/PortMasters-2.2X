// engine module calls at least one of them: pricing and orders ask whether
// a module is equipped, and bartering, purchasing and every other transfer
// of goods reads and writes amounts by item name. Leaving them inside any
// one subsystem would make that subsystem an import target for all the
// others for no reason other than history.

// it climbs, and the climb ends at ship level three (see MAX_SHIP_LEVEL
// in ../constants/ships), so the top of the ladder is three slots.
//
// It was three copies of the same comparison before F3 needed a fourth
// (the shipyard's own slot line, the draft's install or swap label and the
// nudge that points a captain at an empty slot), and the reason it is a
// reader rather than a fourth copy is what the copies already disagreed
// about: a hull can read as over its slots, because a module trade settles
// on two machines that cannot see each other's hulls and the buyer's side
// bolts the module on rather than losing it (see applyModuleTradeSide in
// ./modules). A subtraction floors at zero and says "full" for an
// overfilled hull, which is the answer every one of those readers wants;
// a comparison would need each of them to remember which way a negative
// count reads.

// amount by item name goes through these two rather than reaching into
// state.money / state.inventory directly.
//
// The Gold branch carries the same fallback its sibling always had: the
// inventory's values are scrubbed to numbers by the load
// (normalizeInventory), while the purse itself arrives as whatever the
// save holds, and one damaged blob with a null purse turned every
// affordability read into a comparison against NaN, which reads as
// unaffordable everywhere, and let a trade settle its fee at zero while
// the seller was still credited the agreed price. An unreadable purse now
// reads as empty.

// whether it covers the fee. D3's escort asked it first, the module market
// and the refit bench asked it again in their own words, and three copies
// of one comparison are the drift this tree keeps catching, so the
// comparison lives here beside the purse reader it folds.
//
// The settles deliberately do not ask it, because the server has never
// read a purse and a sale has to complete on both machines whether the
// buyer can cover the fee or not, and the seller's side credits the
// agreed price either way. The settles pay what the purse holds instead
// (see paidFee below), and this reader is the guard that keeps an honest
// buyer out of that asymmetry in the first place: a buyer whose purse is
// short would pay the Gold that is there while the seller credits the
// full agreed price, which mints the difference rather than settling a
// debt.
//
// The whole state is the parameter rather than the purse alone, because
// the reading goes through the tree's own purse reader above: a save
// whose purse arrived damaged reads as empty there rather than as a
// comparison against NaN, and a guard that reached for the field itself
// would call every such captain unable to pay and leave them with no

// =====================================================================
// Bartering: swapping goods and Gold directly with another captain,
// outside the market entirely.
//
// The escrow on post design is the important part. Posting an offer takes
// the offered goods out of the hold immediately rather than at accept
// time, which is what stops a captain from posting the same stock in two
// offers and having both accepted. Everything that follows (withdrawal,
// the sweep when the voyage moves on, and the accepting side) is built
// around that: goods are always in exactly one place, never promised
// twice.
//
// The offer board itself is shared harbor state and lives on the server
// (see the barter:* handlers in src/server/realtime/wiring/barter.ts), and
// the board outlives any single phase now that a captain can post from a
// chat at any point in the voyage. So the release of escrow cannot be decided
// here either: it happens on the one client owned by the captain whose
// offer left the board, reported through useBarter's onRefund the moment
// the board stops listing it. These functions are only the local half,
// moving goods on whichever client they run on.

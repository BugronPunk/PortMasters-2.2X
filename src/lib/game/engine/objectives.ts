// Delivery is per item rather than all at once, and that is the one place
// this departs from the mandate it copies. A mandate is an order: it is
// filled whole or not at all. An objective has to be watchable while it is
// half done, because the design measures the argument the fleet has when the
// number is close, and a number that only ever reads 0 or done produces no
// argument at all.
//
// The goods leave the hold wherever the captain is standing. There is no
// sailing to a port for this, because the engine has no captain location to
// sail from: a port exists per market card and per order, not per captain.

 * What one captain's granted standing still leaves to move.
 *
 * The granted rows are the harbor's answer rather than this hold's: they are
 * this captain's accepted standing on the board, good by good, so the goods
 * and the Gold are the difference between that standing and this captain's
 * own record of it. Three things are held back rather than trusted, and each
 * one is a way a press and its answer can disagree:
 *
 *   A good the deck does not name is dropped, exactly as the harbor drops one,
 *   so a doctored answer cannot move goods a commission never asked for.
 *   A standing that answers below this captain's own record moves nothing,
 *   which is what a press with nothing new to give comes back as. And the
 *   hold is read here, at the moment the answer lands rather than at the
 *   moment the press was made: a hold spent between the press and its answer
 *   hands over only what is still aboard, so the goods the harbor agreed to
 *   take and the goods that leave cannot drift apart.

 * nothing from anyone, a captain offering more than is still owed has
 * only what is owed taken, and two captains handing over at once cannot

 * acceptance holds a report to the same rule (see recordObjectiveReport in
 * src/server/realtime/objective.ts), so the goods that leave a hold and
 * the board the fleet reads agree about what was taken.
 *
 * Pays into revenue and never into score. A delivery is income, so it has
 * to show up in the same places an order reward does or the ledger stops
 * adding up, but it is not a trade order: it must not move Reputation,
 * must not count toward the transaction tally, and must not be able to
 * fire the Word on the Docks claim.

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Supply Barge.
//
// [E1: the Supply Barge] The plan's third part of the Quartermaster fix,
// and the one it calls the ugly fallback: "The Supply Barge is an
// anonymous vendor at every port selling rations at one hundred eighty
// percent of market, never more than eight per leg, and it is
// deterministic from port and leg so it can live in the pure engine with
// no new state."
//
// Every clause of that sentence is a decision this module makes, so it is
// worth saying which reading each one took.
//
// At every port. The vendor does not move with the fleet by accident: the
// port it stands at is drawn from the room's own unlocked ports by the
// leg, so the whole table walks past one Barge at one quay and a reload
// answers the same way twice. Drawn rather than announced, which is what
// keeps it out of the server: nothing here needs a room to agree on
// anything, because the room's numbers are the seed.
//
// Deterministic from port and leg. The lot is a draw on the port and the
// leg together, so a table that met the same eight rations at every quay
// would be looking at a rule rather than at a vendor. The draw is the
// harbor's rag pile read from the other end (see ragsAtPort): one
// function, one seed, and both clients reading it land on the same
// number without a frame being sent.
//
// One hundred eighty percent of market. The price is the market's own
// ration price and the plan's multiplier over it, worked out here rather
// than written down as four Gold, so a balance pass on the price of a
// meal moves this one too. It is rounded up rather than down because Gold
// is whole in this game, and a vendor that rounded down would be selling
// below the premium the plan sets.
//
// Never more than eight per leg. The ceiling is the size of the lot, not
// a shelf: what the vendor has for a captain this leg is drawn at most
// that high, and what the captain takes off it is their own record. That
// is the one piece of state this feature adds, and it is a captain's own
// save rather than anything the room holds, which is what the plan's "no
// new state" is actually about. A vendor with a shelf would need the
// server to hold it, and a shelf two clients could not see each other
// spending would be a desynchronization wearing a merchant's coat. The
// harbor's pile answers the same question the same way, and for the same
// reason.
//
// What the vendor sells is grain, and that is the plan's "rations" read
// through this tree's pantry rather than a fourth thing to decide. A
// ration in this game is the food that never turns (see provisionFood),
// which is the shape C1 shipped when the Larder was a plain number, so a
// captain who wants the food nothing can be wrong about names grain at a
// port as well. The Barge is the same purchase at a worse price, which is
// the whole of what the plan wants it to be.
//
// The layer it stands on is the provisions layer, and it has no switch of
// its own, which is the plan's own rollback read as one: "The Barge is
// the fail safe for a lobby with no Quartermaster, so it cannot be
// removed while the mode is on. Reverting this goal means reverting the
// mode." So there is no flag to read that the mode boundary does not
// already carry, and no build of this branch can be sailing the mode
// without the vendor standing at the quay.

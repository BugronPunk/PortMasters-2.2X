// =====================================================================
// The Three Ages.
//
// A fortnight long rotation that leans the harbor one way or another
// without retuning any of the permanent balance. Each Age lasts two
// weeks, the next takes over, and after the third the cycle repeats.
// Every captain in every harbor shares the same Age at the same moment,
// so the only thing that varies is what the harbor rewards, never who is
// in it.
//
// The modifier on each Age is intentionally small and intentionally
// leaning rather than a power dial: a 50% Reputation bonus on a backing
// pledge that was never called on, a flat 1 Reputation per completed
// barter trade, a raised payout cap on the Broker's Favor. None of these
// change the rules, only the weight of one already legal action, which is
// what keeps an Age from unbalancing a voyage that began under a different
// Age.
//
// Each modifier has exactly one reader, and the readers are the three
// accessors at the foot of this file. That is worth stating plainly
// because it is the whole of a bug these three carried: nothing read a
// modifier, so the banner announced an Age in the present tense and no
// part of the voyage acted on it.

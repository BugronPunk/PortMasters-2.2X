// =====================================================================
// The two things a captain chooses rather than earns: the Boon drafted at
// the head of every round, and the ship Modules bolted on in the shipyard.
//
// Both are drafts with a once per round reroll, but they are deliberately
// priced differently. A Boon reroll costs Gold, because the pool is the
// only scarce thing about it. A Module reroll is free, because the scarce
// thing there is the equippable slot, not the offer.
//
// The module_swap flow is the subtle part. Picking a module with a slot
// free installs it and drops it from the pool immediately, since the pick
// is final. Picking one with every slot full does neither: it parks the
// choice in _newModule and waits, leaving the pool untouched so that
// backing out with "Back to Draft" still shows every original option.
// Only finalizeModuleSwap, once a slot has actually been given up, takes
// it out of the pool. Reversing those two would duplicate a module or
// lose one.
//
// [F2: the card record, and the mode weighting field] The offer weights are
// the cards' own now rather than a table here: each record carries the
// condition it answers, the lean toward a path and the weight its mode runs
// (see ./constants/cards and ../cards), so this file holds the two drafts
// and the flow between them and nothing about any particular card.

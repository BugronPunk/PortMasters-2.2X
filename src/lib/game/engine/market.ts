// The generators here are the reason this file matters. They run on a

// epoch, so every captain gets their own market that is reproducible
// across a reload but different from everyone else's. That only holds
// while the draw depends on nothing but the seed and the charter, which
// is why the pools are passed in as an argument rather than read from
// mutable state, and why genMixedOrder is deliberately a pure function of
// the RNG alone.
//
// genRawOrder, genProductOrder and genMixedOrder are exported rather than
// private because Orders (./orders) draws the trade board with the same
// generators. They were file private before the split purely because

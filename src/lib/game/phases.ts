// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the phases of a leg
//
// [B1: the six phase leg, as data] One record per phase, and the only
// place in the tree where a phase is described. A phase is an identity
// the room synchronizes on (see ./checkpoint.ts for the order and the
// rank, and ./mode.ts for which order a mode walks), a face a captain
// reads, and nothing else: what work happens inside a phase is the
// engine's, and what leaving it does belongs to the engine's spine.
//
// Six of the entries below are the leg: Dawn, Market, Orders, Parley,
// Resolve, Dusk. The engine used to cycle eight room checkpoints, a
// mixture of numbers and strings that had grown one insertion at a time,
// and the design asks for six phases instead. Only one shape can be the
// truth, so the eight are gone and the six are the phases the ready check
// gates. Barter and artisan management, which were checkpoints of their
// own, are now work a captain does inside Parley and Market; see the
// station note on each of those two below.
//
// The rest of the union lives here too, because a captain can be in them
// and every one of them needs a face: the harbor (the pier, before the
// leg begins), the shipyard's two personal sub states, and the two
// terminals. Personal sub states and terminals have never been room
// checkpoints and that rule is unchanged.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock, a database, or a socket. It is a data
// record plus a defensive normalize, the same shape ./difficulty.ts and
// ./mode.ts take and for the same reason, so the interface, the engine
// and the realtime layer can all import it without any of them owning it.
// =====================================================================

// dispatcher held an accent per phase, the voyage rail held a label and a
// short label per phase, and each mode's briefing chart held a label and a
// gradient per leg. Three tables over one fact is three places for a phase
// to be renamed in two of them, and the mode that briefs a captain in the

  // to place a captain against the room can read it (see seatOf below).
  //
  // A fact about the phase, which is why it is named here and not in
  // ./mode.ts: both modes reach their yard through Dusk, and the lap that
  // does not would say so on its own shipyard record rather than by putting
  // a second answer beside the phase's name. Nothing that asks where a room
  // stands reads this, because a room never stands at a personal screen.

  // than one number for the leg, because the phases are not the same
  // pressure: the market is where a round is decided and wants room to
  // think, and the boon draft is one card out of three. The numbers are the
  // authored first cut. What tunes them is the event the clock records when
  // it fires (leg_timed_out, see ../game/telemetry.ts): a leg that runs its
  // full clock with nobody readied means the phase is too short for the
  // work, and one that runs it with the room already readied means

// The cards a captain holds, and the flags they write, and
// the weight the two of them add up to.
//
// The moments that hand boons out live in ./milestones and the voyage's
// one charter moment lives in ./charters; what a captain takes from any
// of them lands here. A held card is stored as an id rather than a
// record, resolved through the pool on every read, so a retuned card is
// the card a captain holds on the next read rather than the one they
// took (the same reason a standing order stores an id).
//
// The flags a held card writes are the durable half: the engine writes
// them wherever the round's flags are written (a round opening, a round
// draft answered, a moment answered; see the call sites in ./engine's
// boons, lifecycle and milestones), so a held effect rides through every
// reset while the round's own flags come and go above it, with no second
// copy of the held effect anywhere and without erasing the round draft's
// own flags. The held keys cannot collide with a round card's, and that
// is the pool's own validator's doing rather than the merge order's (see
// the one owner per key clause in ./cards).
//
// Two fields feed the readers below, one list and one id, and the two
// are shaped differently on purpose: the boons are a list because a
// voyage can hand out several, and the charter is one value because the
// moment is offered once and answered once, with null meaning the
// question has not been asked yet.
//
// Everything here is a pure read or a pure heal of the save. Nothing
// mutates and no clock is read.

/**

 * pool can still answer for.
 *
 * Three kinds of entry are dropped rather than kept. An id the pool does
 * not know is a retired card, which is the design's own rollback read as a
 * load rule ("any boon that grants a durable effect has to be unwound
 * through the same normalization path the rest of the state uses"). An id
 * that is not a boon at all is a write that never came from the answer
 * path. And an id whose card arrives at the round draft is the quiet one:
 * held boons are what make a flag last the voyage, a round boon's flag is
 * meant to last a round, and a round id riding in this list would be
 * durable by accident, which is the one way this field can lie about the
 * record it was written from. A repeat is dropped the same way, because
 * the merge below would read it twice for nothing.
 *
 * What a list is, and what an entry of it may be, is read by the one
 * reader every list of ids shares (see normalizeIdList in ./id-list), so
 * this healing and the voyage's queued moments cannot drift on what a
 * save is allowed to say.

 * same reason it is not power after a reload, and there is one
 * implementation of that reading instead of two that could drift. The
 * mode travels through when the state carries one, so a card the mode
 * does not run is not power here either. The modules are read off the
 * hull the captain carries (a duplicate from the draft's fallback pool is
 * two bolted on modules and counts twice). A card the pool cannot answer
 * for is skipped, so a save that never went through the heal still reads

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Ocean Gambit objective deck.
//
// One public commission per voyage, drawn before it starts, owed by the
// whole fleet. It is the Imperial Mandate wearing a new hat (see
// MANDATE_TEMPLATES in ./difficulty.ts for the mechanism it copies): the
// same port and goods and gold shape, except that a mandate is owed by one
// captain in one round and this is owed by everybody across the voyage.
//
// It is a data module, like ./mode.ts and ./gambit.ts, and for the same
// reason: the server draws the objective to clamp what clients report, the
// engine pays delivery against it, and the interface renders it, and none
// of those three should own the vocabulary the other two have to agree
// with. Nothing here reads a clock, a socket or a database.
//
// The writing rule for this deck is the one rule that matters, and it is
// the plan's: an objective a single captain can satisfy alone produces no
// conversation and gives a saboteur nothing to sabotage, so an objective
// that six captains could finish without talking is rejected outright.
// That is enforced as a property of the data rather than as a note here:
// every entry below asks for at least as many items as a captain begins
// the voyage holding (STARTING_STOCK in ./constants/goods.ts comes to 16), and
// every entry asks for at least two different goods. A hold cannot cover
// one, so the fleet has to buy, trade, or both, and it has to do it over
// more than one round.
//
// Prices are the Emperor's, paid per item, and they run a little above the
// going rate on purpose. A commission is a commission; the cost to a
// captain is the goods and the orders they are not filling, not a discount
// on the goods themselves. These numbers are the balance knob the epic's
// evaluation will move, so they live in one place. The other knob, the
// quota rung that scales a commission with the size of the fleet that owes
// it, lives in this module too and is written out below the deck.

// ========== The quota rung ==========
// The deck's quotas are authored for a founding table, and a voyage with a
// fifth and a sixth captain on it moves half again as much cargo. Left
// alone, one commission gets easier with every extra seat, which is not a
// difficulty setting anybody chose: it is the sabotage window widening as
// the table shrinks, and the Pirate is the captain who pays for it. So the
// quotas scale with the fleet the voyage was dealt to, and only the quotas:
// every price stays put, so a wider commission pays the fleet more for the
// extra cargo rather than paying less per item for it.
//
// Quota per head held constant is what makes the rung flat rather than
// merely harder. Four captains are the deck's authoring table, so four or
// fewer is the anchor and multiplies by nothing, which is what keeps a
// voyage that began before the rung existed on exactly the board it drew.
// Five captains carry a quarter more than four, six carry half again, and
// the rounding is up rather than nearest because the error it can introduce
// (at most one item per good) should fall on the side the Pirate's band
// lives on. A table larger than six sails on the top band: the deal itself
// is authored for six (see ./gambit.ts), and a seventh seat is a size this
// rung has no measurement for.

  // through t() where the band becomes part of a sentence (see the rowed

// draw a new commission rather than replaying one the fleet already met.
//
// The fleet's size is folded in on the same reasoning and adds one case of
// its own: the count is a public fact of the harbor (see Room.voyageSeats),

// it, and a harbor restarted at a different size draws a different

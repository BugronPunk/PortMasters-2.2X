// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the status conventions.
//
// [W3: the status convention] Every state a captain can see says what it
// is, why it happened, and the way back. This module is the one place
// those three clauses are authored: each family below carries a state, a
// cause and a remedy, and every surface composes its sentence from them
// rather than writing its own. scripts/status.ts gates the build on the
// clauses staying whole, and on no second file spelling a guarded one.
//
// The pattern is not new. The field report cycle left four engine log
// lines and two tooltips carrying why and the way back, and this module
// makes that shape the rule rather than six good instances of it. The
// defects it closes are specific: the bench's frozen row had lost the
// remedy its engine lines kept, the hunger sentence was written out per
// surface and would drift, and the rail rendered a shortage in colour
// alone.
//
// A family's clauses are read back two ways. The validator holds every
// sentence to the clauses it declares, and holds every family to all
// three; the check script additionally sweeps the tree, because a
// sentence may be phrased around a clause and never author one again. What
// neither can hold is meaning: the clauses are guarded by their words,
// not their sense, which is why the sweep's comment says so out loud.

 * actionable while the chip is on screen: the bench's wardrobe closes
 * the warmth gap while the leg is open, so the sentence points at the
 * clothes rather than at the next cold leg. The weather itself, the
 * warmth sum the crew is wearing against what the leg asks, is passed
 * in already written by the caller (see warmthText in ./garments),

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the crew, by name.
//
// [C2: crew loss by name] C1 gave the ship a mouth; this module gives the
// roster a face. Two consecutive legs on short rations cost the newest hand
// aboard, permanently and by name, and the name is the point: a number
// going down says a cost, and a name going off a roster says a person. The
// plan calls this the emotional core of the survival edition, and says the
// shape has to be decided now rather than later because a boon in F4
// triggers on this event and a reveal shows it.
//
// Five things about the shape are decisions rather than readings.
//
// The roster stays keyed by artisan type. A flat crew array was the other
// candidate and it was the wrong one: the type is load bearing for the
// work, since production, wages, hiring and the bench all walk
// WORKER_TYPES, and a flat list would have moved every one of those walks
// to buy nothing this feature needs. What the roster was missing was not
// its shape but its identity, so the member carries a name and a number
// rather than the roster changing shape under every reader.
//
// The victim is the newest aboard, and it is a rule rather than a roll.
// The engine draws its randomness from seeded streams (see ./rng), and a
// loss sharing one would shift every later market card in the voyage; more
// to the point, a captain can plan around a rule and cannot plan around a
// die. The newest is the hand the captain has invested least in, which is
// what keeps the loss survivable rather than a reason to stop playing, and
// it leaves the founding artisan standing last, which is a story the
// voyage's own ledger can tell.
//
// A name is drawn once and stored, rather than derived from the order
// aboard. The plan says the pool is worth a content pass of its own once
// the mechanic is proven, and a derived name would rename the crew the day
// that content moved. The draw skips every name the voyage has already
// spent, the living and the lost both, so a hand lost over the side is not
// quietly replaced by a stranger wearing their name.
//
// The run of hungry legs is counted rather than reconstructed. A purchase
// in the market phase can refill the larder after the meal, so the Larder's
// own number at the next Dawn cannot say what the leg before it ate, and a
// run that guessed would either spare a captain the rule or charge them
// for a leg they provisioned through. It is one number, advanced once a
// leg, beside the meal that causes it.
//
// The rule is its own switch. The plan's rollback is explicit that the
// roster shape stays and the loss rule is what goes behind a flag, and the
// two are separable here for a reason worth naming: an operator may want
// the Larder and its shortage without the permanence while a table learns
// the game. The switch is read through the same policy function C1's own
// switch uses, so the two cannot drift in what they accept, and the layer
// switch governs it from above, since without the layer there is no
// shortage for the loss to follow.
//
// Pure: no clock, no socket, no database. The one environment read is the
// switch, documented where it happens.

 *
 * Answering true here does not promise a loss can happen, only that this
 * switch is on: the shortage the rule needs comes from the layer above, so
 * a build with the provisions off loses nobody whatever this says.
 *

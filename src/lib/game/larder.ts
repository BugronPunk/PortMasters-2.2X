// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Larder and Short Rations.
//
// [C1: the Larder and Short Rations] A captain's crew is the artisan
// roster. This tree has called it that since the voyage summary was
// written, and it is already billed once a leg by ./engine/workers, which
// pays a wage for every artisan aboard. This module is the other half of
// that bill: the same crew eats.
//
// Four things about the shape are decisions rather than readings, and each
// of them is worth the sentence it costs here.
//
// The Larder is a plain number and not an inventory of foods. The survival
// edition eventually carries three of those, with spoilage and a split
// hold, and all of that is C4's. Until it lands, a ration is a ration, and
// the number on the screen is how many are aboard.
//
// Rations are bought. The plan never says where they come from, and its own
// evaluation says it from the side: a shortage that "produces no messages
// means the market is not working", which can only be a true reading of a
// shortage the market could have prevented. A Larder that could not be
// refilled would be a countdown rather than a decision, and C2's crew loss,
// which fires after two legs on short rations, would take a head from
// nearly every voyage instead of from the fifth of them the proposal
// expects. That loss has landed since this paragraph was written, and it
// lives in ./crew, which reads this module rather than the other way
// around: the Larder counts the mouths, and the roster is who they are.
//
// The shortage's second effect landed with C4. The plan's sentence is
// "cargo capacity down a quarter", and there was no cargo capacity in
// this tree to take a quarter off: the hold was unbounded, and the
// dashboard, the telemetry reader and the plan's own C4 section each said
// so in writing. The capacity model is built now, in ./hold, and the
// clause lands below on the single capacity read the split hold
// introduces rather than on a hold size invented for it: cargoCapacity
// and cargoRoom are in this module and not in ./hold because the quarter
// is a rule about hunger, and ./hold is arithmetic that reads no rules at
// all. What Short Rations has always cost is the crew's pace, which is
// the other half of the same sentence.
//
// The Larder also stopped being a plain number, which is the rest of
// C4: the three foods, their keeping and their spoiling live in ./foods,
// the hold they sit in lives in ./hold, and the count this module reads
// is the sum of what is aboard. Every reader of the count is unchanged,
// and a captain who buys nothing but grain is playing exactly the game
// C1 shipped.
//
// The layer is one switch, and the switch is an environment value rather
// than a field, so nothing about a voyage is stored differently with it on
// or off. See survivalLayerOn in ./flags for where that value is read and
// for the one cost the browser pays for it.
//
// Pure: no clock, no socket, no database. The one environment read is
// deliberate and it is documented where it happens.

/**
 * The crew eats, once a leg.
 *
 * One ration a head, floored at zero, because a Larder the crew has emptied
 * is empty rather than in debt to its own ship.
 *
 * The leg stamp is what makes "once a leg" true rather than hopeful. A leg
 * opens through more than one path, and two of them can reach the same
 * client for the same leg: the captain who leaves Dusk rolls the round over
 * locally, and every captain in the room is then carried into the same Dawn
 * by the room's advance, which is the entry that calls the draft's opener.
 * Feeding on arrival instead of on a stamp would charge a captain for a leg
 * twice, and a double charge is a silent defect: nothing throws, no screen
 * looks wrong, and the captain simply runs out of food a leg early for a
 * reason they cannot see. The stamp costs one number on the save and takes
 * the question off the table.
 *
 * It is written before the early returns below, so a leg is marked as eaten
 * whether or not there was anything to eat. The rule is "the crew eats once
 * a leg", not "the crew eats once a leg, if", and the difference shows on a
 * captain who hires their first artisan mid leg: marked or not decides
 * whether that artisan eats on the leg they arrived in.
 *
 * [C2: crew loss by name] It answers whether this call was the leg's meal,
 * and that answer is what keeps the price of hunger on the same stamp. The
 * Dawn tick settles two legs of short rations beside this meal (see
 * settleHunger in ./crew), and a caller that asked the crew's hunger for
 * itself would ask it twice on the leg that arrives through two paths,
 * advancing the run twice and taking a hand a leg early in silence. One
 * stamp, one meal, one price. The answer is false when the switch is off
 * as well, since the rules that would read it are not running.

 * asked for four legs with room for one buys one, and one who can afford
 * half of what they asked for buys half, because a store that turned
 * custom away over an amount the buyer could not have known would be a
 * worse merchant than the ones this game is about. What it will not do is

 * returns zero and says why, so the panel can print the reason rather than

// =====================================================================
// [F2: the card record, and the mode weighting field] The walk over the
// pool: every question the tree asks about a card is one of the readers
// here, and every one of them reads the record rather than the table it
// came from. ./constants/cards holds the shape and ./constants/drafts
// holds the cards, the same split F1 took between the vocabulary and the
// rule over it.
//
// The readers, in the order they are asked:
//
//   - cardById, cardsOfKind and cardText are the door. Nothing outside
//     this file indexes the pool by hand, and the surface a captain reads
//     is read through cardText, which is why J3's translation is a change
//     to that one accessor rather than a hunt through every screen.
//
//   - The two tag readers are F1's, and this is where they first go to
//     work in production: holdOfTag sums the hold over the goods a tag
//     names (through entriesWithTag) and cargoCarriesTag asks the same
//     question of an order's own manifest (through tagsOf). Together they
//     are what let a card's effect say "woven" and mean it, which is the
//     epic's own instruction ("Tag everything, and let effects reference
//     tags rather than items").
//
//   - cardWeight is the offer's weight, and it is the product of the three
//     fields that carry one: the mode's weight, the condition's answer, and
//     the lean toward the captain's path. The plan's own words for the
//     third are the reason it multiplies rather than filters: "Path
//     weighting is what makes an offer feel like it belongs to you without
//     locking you out of the rest of the pool".
//
//   - validateCards is the content check, run by scripts/cards.ts ahead of
//     every build, the way scripts/tags.ts already gates the tag rule. It
//     is deliberately a reduction over a subject rather than a read of the
//     shipped tables, so the checks can build a pool with one thing wrong
//     in it and watch the clause fire: a detector nobody has watched fire
//     is a detector nobody has tested.
//
//   - The tally and its reader are F2's evaluation, which the plan states
//     as a measurement rather than a feature: "Offer to pick conversion per
//     card, with the appearance count beside it, because a card with a high
//     win rate over nine appearances is noise and a card with a high win
//     rate over four hundred is a problem." The tally rides the captain's
//     own state rather than the telemetry event stream, which is I2's
//     precedent for data that must not fight the event cap: it is a few
//     counters on a save, and the report reads them back.

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: game engine
//
// Ported faithfully from the original single player build. All wording,
// log messages, balance, and phase flow are preserved verbatim.
//
// [ONLINE EXTENSION] The one behavioural addition is a seedable PRNG
// (mulberry32) used for the session economy. Port market cards, trade
// orders, and the Broker's intel pool are generated deterministically from
// (roomId + userId + voyageEpoch + round), so each captain has their own
// market, orders, and intel: reproducible on reload, different from every
// other captain, and rerolled into a brand new voyage whenever the host
// restarts (which bumps voyageEpoch, see prisma/schema.prisma and
// src/lib/use-game-session.ts). Each captain's gold, reputation, inventory,
// workers, and personal luck (Salvage Crane refunds, Tax Evasion audits,
// boon offerings) are their own too.
//
// One new gameplay skill, Broker's Favor, is layered on top of the faithful
// port: a Renown gated, once per voyage guaranteed buyer (see
// callBrokersFavor). It draws with a captain's own live randomness, so it
// stays personal and never perturbs their seeded market.
//
// =====================================================================
// This file is now a barrel. The engine itself lives in ./engine/*, one
// module per subsystem, matching how ./backing.ts, ./convoy.ts and the
// rest of this directory were already organised. Nothing moved between
// subsystems and no behaviour changed; the split is purely about where
// the code sits.
//
// The barrel exists so that the files importing `@/lib/game/engine` never
// had to change, and so that this stays the one public entry point to the
// engine. Import from here, not from the individual modules, unless you
// are inside ./engine/ yourself.
//
// What the barrel carries is the surface an outside caller actually
// reads: everything a panel, a hook or a route needs. A subsystem's own
// internals are deliberately left out, since the only code that calls
// them lives beside them under ./engine/. Both of those rules are load
// bearing. An export nothing imports is the same dead weight as a dead
// function, and it is harder to spot, because it looks like a deliberate
// offering rather than an oversight.
//
// The dependency flow is one way and worth preserving:
//
//   core            no dependencies, used by nearly everything
//   pricing         core
//   market          core, pricing
//   orders          core, pricing, market
//   draft           orders (the two writes read the manifest's locks)
//   workers         core, pricing
//   barter          core
//   pirates         core
//   aid             owns the shared helper Reputation ceiling
//   backingState    aid
//   convoyState     no engine dependencies
//   boons           market
//   lifecycle       imports from nearly all of the above, and nothing
//                   imports from it
//
// Only lifecycle sits at the top, because only lifecycle sequences the
// others. Adding an import that points back down into it would create the
// first cycle in the engine, so please don't.
// =====================================================================

// ========== Primitives ==========
// addOwnedAmount is intentionally absent: it was private to the engine
// before the split and stays private to it now. hasModule is absent for
// the same reason, every caller sits under ./engine/ and asks it directly.
// moduleSlotsOpen is here because its callers are exactly the ones that
// rule was written for: the two shipyard screens outside ./engine/, the
// nudge in the action suggester, and F3's own trade panel, all of them
// asking a hull the same question and all of them wanting the same
// floored answer (see its own comment in ./engine/core for why a
// subtraction rather than a comparison).

// ========== Pricing, taxes and wages ==========
// The explain* breakdowns are here because the tooltips are: Purchase,
// Orders and PriceTooltips all show a captain where a price came from, so
// they read the breakdown directly rather than rebuilding it.

// settled inside ./engine/, which is also where the only readers of those

// is beside the socket that speaks on it (see
// src/server/realtime/bazaar.ts). The server reads rumorCooldownLeft,
// rumorCanLand, rumorGoodAllowed, rumorId, rumorLean and publicRumors off
// this barrel, and the desk reads rumorSpokeIn and rumorNextLeg beside
// them, and every one of them takes its rows and its leg as arguments, so
// the suite holds the rule without opening a server.
//
// canPublishRumor is the desk's, and it is the Aroma path's own reader
// rather than a second copy of the flag: it asks the switch and the path

// [D2: the nine slot order board] canFillOrder and its two path readers are
// here rather than staying module private, because the board now has to ask
// the same question the engine asks before it presses: which orders are
// this captain's, and why one of them is not. The answers are computed in

// ========== The Free Captain's borrow ==========
// [D6: Free Captain: Opportunist] The allowance, the payout and the
// sentences the borrow is described with. Exported for the reason the
// other ability readers are: four layers read this rule and none of them
// owns it. The board asks what it may offer (opportunistMayBorrow) and
// what the offer pays (opportunistPayout, opportunistBorrowsLeft), the
// card and the ledger print the same sentence (opportunistLine) and the
// card alone prints what is left of the allowance (opportunistUsesLine,
// OPPORTUNIST_SPENT_LINE), the leg report files what a voyage spent
// (opportunistBorrowsTaken) and the save's heal reads
// normalizeOpportunistBorrows. completeOrder is the only caller that
// spends one, and it reads the same readers the board does, so what the
// button promises and what the engine pays cannot come apart.
//
// [F6: charters at leg four] The Factor made two of those answers stateful,
// and the block grew the readers with them: opportunistAllowance is the
// voyage's count under the charter, and opportunistIsBorrower is the door
// the path or the charter holds open, which the board's spent line asks
// rather than comparing a path itself.

// ========== The draft, and switching ==========
// [D7: the draft, and switching] The two writes a path leaves in a
// captain's save, and the one refusal that guards the second. The rule
// they read (the deck, the pass, the window and the fee) lives outside
// the engine, in ./draft, for the reason ./engine/contracts and
// ./engine/bazaar state
// about their own arithmetic: it holds no state, so the suite can hold it
// without a server, and only the two apply functions here touch a save.
//
// pathSwitchBlocked is exported because two callers ask it the same
// question and they have to agree: the panel that offers the switch, and
// the frame handler that applies it when the room publishes one, so a
// switch that arrives twice costs nothing rather than a second fee.
// pathSwitchOpenLine is the "when" half of that same guard, exported on
// its own because the third caller is across the wire: the room refuses a
// switch outside the window before it publishes one (see the path:switch
// handler), and it has to refuse it in the same words the engine would.
// pathSwitchSpentLine is the other half of that one sentence's trip, the
// once a voyage refusal, and it is out here for the same reason: the room
// reads a book of its own to answer whether the allowance was spent, and
// the answer it gives a captain has to be the engine's own words.
// forfeitPathOrders and the three ledger lines are deliberately absent:
// each is written for one caller and read nowhere else, and the two
// callers are the writes above, applyDraftPath for the line it takes and
// applyPathSwitch for the other two, so a reader out here would be a
// second surface printing a save's own log.

// captain off. Both are reached by name from a socket handler rather than

// ./engine/seats: the maroon arrives as a broadcast the client has to

  // predicate rather than a second guess written at the button.
  moduleDraftPossible,
  // Whether the draft can swap at all, forwarded for the same reason: the

// ========== The consent primitive ==========
// [D4: Loom: the Refit] The agreement shape two kinds of trade are made of,
// exported here because three callers read it and none of them is the kind
// that happens to share it. The room's two board modules read the policy
// helpers, visibleConsent, expireConsent, consentOfferStanding, agreeConsent
// and consentPartyBusy, which are the rules about what a price is, who sees
// a row, when an offer expires and what an accept consumes; they live in the
// game layer rather than in the socket closures for the reason ./convoy.ts
// gives about its own arithmetic, so a rule can be tested without a live
// server. consentSettled is the one reading of which states commit, and it
// is exported for the three callers that judge a status rather than carry
// one: the busy rule, the escort's cover mirror and the client relay that
// reports a settled row. The client layer reads consentFeeFor for the form a
// seller types into, and normalizeConsentLedger at the load site, where a
// save is healed.
//
// The type is the other half of the export and the more important one: both
// ends of the wire import ConsentTerms from here rather than each declaring
// a shape the other has to be kept in step with.

// ========== The escort contract ==========
// [D3: Convoy: the Escort Contract] The Convoy's market, split the way
// ./engine/pirates.ts was split from its own panel: the rules are here and
// the board that shows them is a component. Three callers read this block,
// and each reads a different part of it. The client layer that owns a
// captain's side of a contract reads applyEscortSide and coverFromBoard,
// both of them from the room, which is where a relay becomes a state change.
// The two screens that draw the market read the questions a captain asks of
// it: canSellEscort, escortCoverage, canPayFee and ESCORT_SELLER_PATH
// at the Parley table, and escortCoverOf on the Resolve screen, where it
// says whose guns
// are standing over the raid. That last one is read here rather than
// testing the switch and the field on the screen, so a build with the
// market off reads as uncovered wherever it is asked. visibleContracts is
// the board one captain sees, which is the shared privacy filter plus the
// one field only this kind carries.
//
// The board's other rules are not here because they are not this kind's:
// what a fee is, which rows are visible, when an offer expires, the accept
// that sweeps the rest and the ledger of applied movements are the consent
// primitive above, and a wrapper for each would be a second name for one
// rule. That includes the bound on a second cover, which the panel reads as
// consentPartyBusy(rows, "buyer", ...) with the side named where it is
// asked, since the side is the whole of what the two markets differ on
// there.
//
// escortClaimFrom is deliberately absent. Its one caller is the raid roll
// two blocks up, which is inside ./engine/ and reaches it directly.
// escortSellerLabels was here and is not, which is worth the line: it
// gathered the crest and the name a board draws, and the order board already
// answers that question by calling pathConfig on the id it was handed (see
// Orders.tsx). A second way to ask it would have been a second answer to
// what a path looks like.
//
// canPayEscortFee was here as well and is now ./core's canPayFee, forwarded
// from the core export above: the escort asked the purse question first,
// the module market and the refit bench asked it again in their own words,
// and one comparison in one place is worth more than three beside their own
// fees.

// ========== The Loom's bench ==========
// [D4: Loom: the Refit] The three things the plan hands this path, in the
// order a captain meets them at the port. buyRag and reweaveRags are the
// crafting chain and the exclusive right to the harbor's pile; mendGarment
// and ragsAtPort are what a captain can do alone, which is the baseline the
// refit is priced against; refitSellerBusy, refitRoomFor and canSellRefit
// are the questions a Loom captain asks before offering; and applyRefitSide
// is the client layer's, where a relay becomes the one state change in this
// engine that a second captain asked for. The point a refit puts back is
// read through refitRoomFor rather than worked out on a screen, so the
// number an offer quotes and the number the warmth moves by are one number.
//
// refitsOn is exported with them rather than from ./flags, for the reason
// its own comment gives: it stands on the wardrobe, and ./garments already
// reads ./flags. normalizeRefitState is the load site's, healing the tally
// this build added, and ragsLeftAtPort is the bench panel's, which prints

// ========== The module trade ==========
// [F3: modules in the shipyard ladder, and trading them between captains]
// The third consent kind, split the way the two before it were: the rule
// is here and the two boards that show it are a component and a socket
// module. Three callers read this block and each reads a different part.
// The Parley panel asks the seller's question, canSellModule, and the
// listing lock, moduleListedThisLeg, which is the kind's own bound and
// bound to the row rather than to a side (see its own comment); the
// server's post handler asks isModuleId before it publishes a row, since
// a module id is the one thing about a listing it can check without
// reading anybody's save; the client layer that owns a captain's side of
// an agreement reads applyModuleTradeSide, which is both the seller's
// automatic unequip the plan asked for and the buyer's pay, then bolt on.
//
// normalizeModuleTradeState is the load site's, healing the tally this
// build added, and the two traffic readers are the plan's second
// evaluation: readModuleTraffic pairs what the saves carry against what
// they traded away, over a subject handed in rather than reached for, and
// shippedModuleTraffic is that reading against the pool this build
// shipped, which is what npm run report:modules prints. That report is
// also normalizeModulesTraded's second caller, which is the one reason
// the per module ledger's heal is exported on its own rather than staying
// inside the state heal above it.
//
// The sweep of one module listed twice, the one open offer per seller, the
// fee's shape, the visibility rule, the expiry and the ledger that makes a
// settle idempotent are the consent primitive's, not this kind's, and a
// wrapper for each would be a second name for one rule: that is the same
// sentence the escort block above carries, and it is the point of the
// primitive rather than a shortcut.

// ========== Milestone boons ==========
// [F4: boons at milestone moments] The second way a boon reaches a
// captain, and the part of it that needs a public name is the answer:
// answerMilestone is the overlay's one call, taking the card the captain
// pressed off the head of the queue or refusing a card the head no
// longer deals (see ./engine/milestones for why a refusal is a real
// answer). The arming side stays inside ./engine/ and is not forwarded:
// queueMilestoneMoment is called by the two sweeps and the three site
// moments, and the sweeps are called by the dawn and the settlement
// beside their own ticks, so a caller outside ./engine/ meets a moment
// through the voyage rather than through a name.
export { answerMilestone } from "./engine/milestones";

// ========== Charters ==========
// [F6: charters at leg four] The voyage's one charter, and the part of it
// that needs a public name is the answer: answerCharter is the overlay's
// one call, taking the card the captain pressed off the trio or refusing
// a card the trio no longer deals (see ./engine/charters for why a
// refusal is a real answer). The reading side stays in ./charters and is
// not forwarded: the overlay imports what is due and what is offered from
// there, the way the boon draft imports its own pair, so a caller meets
// the question through the module that asks it.
export { answerCharter } from "./engine/charters";

// ========== The Supply Barge ==========
// [E1: the Supply Barge] The mode's fallback vendor, and the whole of the
// feature is one sale: buyFromBarge, at a premium the constants set and
// out of a lot drawn from the port and the leg. bargePortAtLeg,
// bargeLotAtPort, bargeRationPrice and bargeLeftAtPort are the four
// questions the provisions panel asks before it draws the row, and
// bargeRoomMeals and bargePurseRations are the two ceilings the sale and
// the panel are both held to, read from one place; bargeOn is
// the layer the vendor stands on, which is the provisions layer itself
// rather than a switch of its own, because the plan's rollback for this
// goal is reverting the mode (see barge); and normalizeBargeState is the
// load site's, healing the per leg tally and the voyage's two food
// counters.
//
// The two counters are read back off the leg report rather than exported
// to a reader here, for the reason every other feature's figures are: a
// number only one surface reads is a number that belongs to that surface

// The departures are deliberately not forwarded: completeOrders,
// finishSettlement and skipUpgrade are private to ./engine/lifecycle.ts.
// Every panel reaches the spine through nextPhase or lockInBoon, and
// exporting one of the three again would give the engine a second route
// around the lap.
//
// The same goes for the per phase enter and complete steps further up
// this file: completeMarket, startOrders, completeParley and selectBoon
// are each called by ./engine/lifecycle.ts and nothing else, and it
// reaches them through their own submodules rather than through here.
// A second export of a step whose only caller is the spine is what made the
// second route possible in the first place, so they stay off the public
// surface. A caller outside ./engine/ advances a voyage with nextPhase
// and never by naming a step.
//
// autoCommit is here beside nextPhase rather than among the private steps,
// because it is not a step either: it is the whole of a departure, the one a
// client runs when the room's clock ran out on a captain who was holding
// nothing (see [B2] in ./engine/lifecycle.ts). Its one caller is the phase
// sync hook.
//
// leavePhase and canLeavePhase are here for the same reason and have the same
// caller, with the press a captain makes by hand in place of the clock: they
// are the departure a generic "I am done with this seat" press makes, and the
// question of whether there is one. They are two names for one rule read at

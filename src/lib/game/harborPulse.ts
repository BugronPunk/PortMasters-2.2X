// =====================================================================
// [MANIFEST 01: The Harbor Pulse] Pure market pricing formula, split out of
// src/server/realtime/index.ts (the same reason pools.ts was split out of
// difficulty.ts): this is real money math that decides every captain's next
// round's prices, and it belongs next to the rest of the pure game logic in
// src/lib/game/ rather than nested inside attachRealtime's socket closures,
// where nothing outside a live server could import or unit test it without
// dragging in Prisma/socket.io as a side effect.
//
// The server is still the one authority that owns *when* this runs, and
// it takes two hands: every captain's per round purchase report is
// tallied through addPulseReport in
// src/server/realtime/wiring/pulse.ts, and the pulse is then computed
// exactly once by maybeAdvance in src/server/realtime/checkpoint.ts, at
// the moment the harbor advances into the next round's Market. This module
// only owns the formula itself.
// =====================================================================

// Turns a round's raw summed quantities into a small per item price
// multiplier: an item the harbor leaned into harder than an even split gets
// pricier, one nobody touched gets cheaper. PULSE_CAP bounds it to a lean
// rather than a shove, and an empty or missing tally (round 1, or a round
// nobody reported for) is neutral rather than guessed at.
//
// `universe` is the raw goods that round's market actually put on the board
// (see unlockedResources). The neutral share is an even split between them,
// so it has to be counted rather than assumed: a flat one in three is right
// only while the harbor trades exactly three goods, and an even split of
// seven read off a flat third would take the full discount at once and stop
// saying anything about what the harbor had done. Passing nothing falls back
// to the goods in the tally, which is the best an unknown market allows.

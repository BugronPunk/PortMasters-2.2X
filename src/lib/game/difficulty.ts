// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: difficulty modes
//
// One data record defines every difficulty tier, and a thin layer of pure
// selectors derives each in game dial from it. This mirrors the earlier
// build's own design (a single DIFFICULTIES record plus difficultyRules
// helpers), rebuilt around this release's own systems.
//
// Difficulty is a ROOM property (see Room.difficulty in prisma/schema.prisma):
// the host picks it once, and every captain in the harbor resolves the same
// tier. Because the tier and the round number are the only inputs to every
// selector here, and both are identical for everyone in a room, each
// captain's seeded market and orders keep their own personal draw while the
// structure (how many cards, how likely a raid) stays consistent room wide.
//
// The "fair_winds" tier is the founding game: 8 rounds, a flat 0.2 raid
// chance, a 0.1 escort fee, 6 cards on each board, no mandates and no
// corrupt brokers. The two richer tiers vary those dials, which is why
// they live in a record rather than as flat constants. The three tiers
// sit side by side in the README, under Difficulty tiers.

// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the split hold.
//
// This module is the capacity model the design asks for and the one the
// Larder's own header promised: "the capacity model is the split hold's
// to build, and the clause lands there, on the single capacity read the
// split hold introduces". It is that read, in two halves and one
// arithmetic, and everything here is a count rather than a rule about
// eating: what a hold holds, what is in it, and what is left. The policy
// above the arithmetic, the switch and the quarter a hungry crew costs,
// is read in ./larder, which is where the shortage it depends on already
// lives.
//
// Three readings shape the module, and each is worth the sentence.
//
// The first is that slots are filled fractionally and counted exactly. A
// slot of produce is three meals and a crew eats one meal at a time, so a
// hold holding two meals of produce is holding two thirds of a slot, and
// this module says so rather than rounding in either direction. Rounding
// down would sell a captain space they do not have; rounding up would
// waste space they do. The one place a fraction is rounded is a screen's
// own display, and it rounds up there, because a slot with anything in it
// is a slot in use.
//
// The second is that the model is off by default in exactly the way the
// base game is off: with the provisions layer switched off there is no
// capacity read anywhere, and with the layer on but the split switched
// off there is one unbounded pool for goods and the Larder's own meal
// ceiling for food, which is the game this tree shipped before this
// module existed (see holdCapacityOn below and splitHoldOn in ./flags).
//
// The third is that nothing here refuses anything. This module answers
// what fits; the market is where a purchase that does not fit is turned
// away and told why (see purchaseCard in ./engine/market). Keeping the
// refusal at the door that sells is what lets every other inflow, a
// craft, a barter, a favor, land in a hold that is already full rather
// than be destroyed to make room for a rule about shopping.
//
// Pure: no clock, no socket, no database, and no flags of its own beyond
// the two it is switched by.

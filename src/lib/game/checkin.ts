// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: Daily Check In
// A position based weekly reward cycle tied to a captain's account, not
// any single harbor. Pure functions only (no React, no Prisma), so both the
// client (the lobby widget) and the server (the /api/check-in route) can
// share the exact same day math and reward table.
//
// The cycle deliberately is NOT a streak. Progress advances by exactly one
// each time a captain actually claims, and never resets on a missed day.
// A captain who skips a week simply resumes on whatever day they were on.
// The only reset is the automatic wrap back to Day 1 after Day 7 is
// claimed. "One claim per day" is enforced by the UTC calendar date, so a
// second claim on the same date is rejected.
// =====================================================================

// Reward for each day of the cycle, in Renown XP. Index 0 is Day 1. These
// feed the same Renown ladder a voyage's Reputation does (see
// src/lib/game/legacy.ts), so a week of check ins is a few early levels and
// a rounding error near the top of the curve.

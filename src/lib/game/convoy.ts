// =====================================================================
// [MANIFEST 04: Convoy Ventures] Pure decision logic, split out of
// src/server/realtime/index.ts for the same reason computeHarborPulse was split
// out into harborPulse.ts: this is real Gold math and the one exploit
// prevention rule (one filled venture per voyage, room wide) that a
// doctored client or a race between two captains has to actually be safe
// against, and none of it can be unit tested while it sits nested inside
// attachRealtime's socket closures, where nothing outside a live server
// with a live database could import or exercise it.
//
// The server (src/server/realtime/index.ts) is still the one authority over
// *when* each of these run and over the one check that genuinely can't be
// pure, hasRoomClaimedVenture, which has to ask the database whether any
// venture in this room's voyage has ever reached "filled". Everything here
// is a plain function of its arguments: parse a stored JSON blob, total a
// contribution map, decide how much of a contribution a venture can
// actually use, decide a settlement's payout rate and per contributor
// amounts, and decide the valid deadline window for a fresh post.

// path sells protection, and this is the harbor's pooled investment. The
// plan's own section keeps the name it was written under, every identifier
// here keeps it too (a persisted model's name is a migration rather than a
// copy change), and what moved is the sentence a captain reads. See the

// [MANIFEST 04 fix] Two caps stack here, both bounding the same
// contribution request from above:
//
// The overflow cap: a contribution can never push a venture's pooled total
// past its own target. This is what keeps the settlement math exact (a
// filled venture's contributions always sum to precisely targetGold, so
// paying each contributor contribution times CONVOY_VENTURE_PAYOUT_
// MULTIPLIER never needs a proportional share calculation at all) and what
// stops a captain from being charged more Gold than a venture could
// actually use.
//
// The per contributor cap: no single captain may hold more than
// CONVOY_VENTURE_MAX_CONTRIBUTOR_SHARE of a venture's own target across
// every contribution they've made to it. Without this, a captain could
// post a venture and fill the entire target alone in one contribution,
// which both prints free Gold and burns the room's one shared chance for
// personal gain instead of the room's; requiring real headroom to remain
// for someone else is what actually forces genuine multi captain
// participation before a venture can ever fill.
//
// That cap is a Gold figure, and the same one is read in three places: the
// accept decision below, the refusal the venture:contribute handler words
// (src/server/realtime/wiring/ventures.ts), and the board that swaps a
// captain's own form for a note once they reach it
// (src/components/portmasters/game/status/ConvoyVentures.tsx). All three
// call contributorShareCap, because a cap printed one Gold off from the
// cap actually enforced is a button lit for an amount the server refuses.

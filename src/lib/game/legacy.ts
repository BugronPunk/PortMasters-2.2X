// Persistent, cross voyage progression tied to a captain's account
// rather than any single room. A voyage's Gold, cargo, and ship level
// always reset (see the restart flow in
// src/server/realtime/wiring/restart-voyage.ts), but the Reputation
// banked on the way to the voyage's final round is now worth something
// once the voyage ends too: it becomes Renown XP, carried across every
// harbor that captain ever sails in. Pure functions only, so both the
// client (the Captain's Legacy card) and the server (the voyage
// conclusion in src/server/realtime/conclusion.ts, alongside the check in
// and house routes) can import this without pulling in anything React or
// Prisma specific.

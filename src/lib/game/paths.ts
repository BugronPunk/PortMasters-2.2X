// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the paths.
//
// [D1: the path configuration module, and the naming change] One record
// per path, and every fact about a path written down exactly once. This is
// the shape ./difficulty.ts uses for tiers and ./mode.ts for modes, for the
// same reason all three share it: the interface, the engine and the server
// all have to agree about what a path is, and the way they agree is that
// exactly one of them writes it down.
//
// What a path is: a captain's identity at a table, built around one verb
// and one ability that acts on another captain, because nobody forms an
// identity around an inventory category (see Epic D of the plan). The
// record below is the mechanic side of that identity and it is all data:
// the crest a locked order card wears, the sentence a card prints, the
// goods the ability touches, the goods whose manifest orders lock to the
// path, the multiplier its hold carries, and the Renown it banks to.
//
// The id type is derived from the record, and that is the one structural
// decision here worth the paragraph. `PathId` is `keyof typeof PATHS`, so a
// sixth path is one entry in this file and nothing else in the tree has to
// move; there is deliberately no enum, no parallel list of ids and no hand
// written ORDER array, because each of those is a second place to edit and
// the day one of them is missed is the day a path exists that half the tree
// cannot see. The plan's own evaluation asks for exactly this property, and
// the cycle that built this file proved it by adding a sixth path to the
// record and building the tree without touching anything else.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock, a database or a socket, and there is no
// environment value behind it: a path is content, so retuning one is an
// edit to this record rather than a deploy. The slice that lets a captain
// hold one at all is D7's draft, which deals every seat a hand as the
// voyage leaves the dock, so the pathless captain this record keeps
// describing is the one who arrived after the deal rather than the one who
// has not chosen yet (see pathConfig).
//
// The naming change is the other half of D1 and it has two halves of its
// own. The plan's instruction is that faction becomes path everywhere: this
// tree never used the retired word in the product, and the one place it
// survived (a comment in src/app/palette.css, naming the Great Houses'
// colours) was swept in the same pass, so what a reader meets in code is
// path and nothing else. The second half is that Variable stops being a
// name for a hidden card, which is a rule about handles rather than about
// taste: a word a captain can spend naming the thing somebody is hiding
// turns the first question at every table into an accusation, and the word
// belongs to the mode besides. The tell now lives in ./gambit.ts as the
// hidden card, in the code, in the schema comment and in the suite's own
// labels, and no screen has ever printed it.
//
// One collision was recorded here rather than silently resolved, because
// resolving it was not D1's to do: the word Convoy already named a pooled
// contribution on the harbor's venture board (MANIFEST 04, see ./convoy.ts),
// and the path below shares the word. D3 resolved it, and resolved it this
// way: the path keeps the name, because the plan's own content and the
// draft that deals a path to every captain are written in it, and the
// venture's player facing label moved instead, from Convoy Ventures to
// Ventures, so the one word a captain meets on the boards names one thing
// again. The venture's code keeps its historical identifiers, which is a
// note ./convoy.ts carries rather than a second rename: the model is
// persisted and a persisted name is a migration, not a copy change.

  // slots are drawn from, and the plan's phrase for that is one per pool,
  // which is one per pool the manifest can trade rather than one per path:
  // the Quartermaster's pool is C4's provisions, and provisions are pantry
  // goods bought at RATION_PRICE a meal and never sold back to a port. An
  // order for them would price like every other manifest order (five Gold
  // an item and up against a ration that costs two) and would let a
  // captain turn the till into a levy on their own larder, which is the
  // one trade this tree has deliberately never had. So the seat brings the

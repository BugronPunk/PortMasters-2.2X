// =====================================================================
// [Bilingual Harbor: the language pack and its readers] The one place
// the tree asks what language it is printing in. Every captain facing
// string ships twice: the English the source carries, and the Mandarin
// that arrives with this pack (./zh.json, the file the mapping document
// points at). The readers here are the whole switch, the same shape the
// card layer took when it let cardText pick: one door rather than a hunt
// through every screen.
//
// The book is keyed by the English itself. A call site passes the string
// it would have printed (t("Harbor")), the file holds the pairing
// ("Harbor" straight to its Mandarin), and the reader answers whichever
// language is current. The English literal stays in the source, where
// the smoke suites pin it, and the translation rides beside it rather
// than replacing it. Tokens arrive in braces ("{n} coins") and
// interpolate() fills them from the call's own parameters; the two
// languages carry the same token names for the values and differ freely
// in the words between them, because Chinese drops what it does not need
// rather than carrying a translation of it.
//
// Two reads need saying out loud. The first is that the flat text map
// keeps the earlier leaf where the file carries one English string
// twice. The file carries none of those now: every leaf is a string of
// its own, so the map has nothing to choose between, and the reading on
// a screen is the reading written in the file. The second is the read by
// id. A card's Mandarin is not written beside its English in the record,
// it is written here, so a card is asked for by the id the pool knows it
// by (card.<id>.name and card.<id>.desc) rather than by the text it
// prints. The two doors answer different questions, and the card layer
// asks the second.
//
// Missing entries fail open: an English string with no leaf prints
// itself, in either language, because a missing row is a gap in the pack
// rather than a reason to print nothing at all. The pack's completeness
// is held where it belongs, by the smoke suite that walks every t()
// literal in the tree against this file, so the runtime reader can stay
// this small.
// =====================================================================

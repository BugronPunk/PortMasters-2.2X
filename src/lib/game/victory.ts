// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the Ocean Gambit victory rules.
//
// One card decides what winning means for the captain holding it, and the
// three cards mean three different things. An Honest card wins when the
// fleet's commission is met and the personal goal that came with the card
// is met with it. A Broker card wins on coin taken from other captains and
// does not care what the commission does, which is the property the design
// leans on hardest: the Broker is greedy rather than hostile, so a voyage
// the fleet completes and the Broker gets rich in is a voyage two sides
// won. A Pirate card wins when the commission fails, and only if the Pirate
// comes out of it solvent and standing, because a traitor who has to run a
// working business to win is a traitor who can be caught.
//
// One file holds the rule and the read that feeds it, the same way
// ./integrity.ts holds both checkSave and the snapshotFromSave it judges:
// the ending a rule is measured on is read out of a save blob a client
// wrote, so the reading is untrusted work with a discipline of its own, and
// separating it from the rule would only put the two in different files.
// The rules themselves take numbers and give a verdict. No clock, no
// socket, no database, no randomness.
//
// The server evaluates this once at conclusion, with the numbers it
// already holds, and writes the answer onto the captain's own Chronicle
// row. Nothing here is broadcast: the reveal is a later slice, and a win
// condition that announced itself would be an alignment leak with extra
// steps.
//
// The numbers below are the mode's balance knobs, and each one is the
// first thing to move when a band reads wrong rather than the role itself.
// The plan's bands live in one place, WIN_RATE_TARGETS in ./balance: an
// honest side's share of voyage wins, with a Broker's and a Pirate's
// beside it.

 * never struck a deal, and both halves of the hold are read through
 * normalizeInventory, which is this tree's one reader of an untrusted
 * record of amounts. Reusing it is deliberate rather than a slip: the hold
 * and the delivery tally have exactly the same shape, and a second copy of
 * the same loop is how the two would come to disagree about what a
 * readable amount is.
 *
 * `reported` wins over the blob wherever the two overlap, because the

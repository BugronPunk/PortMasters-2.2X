// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: unlocked content pools
//
// What a captain can actually see this round, given the harbor's difficulty
// and how far the voyage has run. ./constants owns the content, ./difficulty
// owns the schedule, and this module is the one place the two meet: keeping
// it separate is what lets constants/ read difficulty copy without the two
// importing each other in a cycle.
//
// Every pool keys off the same unlockedTierFor, so goods, ports, artisans,
// boons, modules, and market breadth can never disagree about what has
// arrived. On Fair Winds the tier is always 0, so every function here returns
// exactly the founding trade and nothing else.

// Whether a good arrived with a charter rather than being part of the founding

// isCharterGood above answers whether a good arrived with a charter at all,
// which is the right question for the Maritime Bureau Token (its text names
// no wave) and the wrong one here: gating both boons on it made them the
// same boon, since a captain holds only one at a time (applyBoon replaces
// modifierFlags wholesale) and whichever they held paid out on either wave.
//
// Each reader covers its whole wave, the raw goods and the finished ones
// together, because that is what the card's word "goods" promises and what
// the schedule actually brings: the first charter opens the clay and the ore
// as well as the mirror and the celadon, and an order for the clay is an
// order for the first charter's goods. The readers used to name the finished
// list alone, so half of each wave paid nothing while the card promised the
// wave.
//
// [F2: the card record, and the mode weighting field] These two readers stay
// here rather than becoming tag reads, and that is the one place in the
// engine F1's rule does not reach: which wave a good arrived with is the
// schedule's fact and not the good's, so a tag would be the same good tagged
// two ways in two harbors (see the same note in ./engine/orders).

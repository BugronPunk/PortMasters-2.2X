// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: shared checkpoint ordering
//
// Pure helpers with no React, no Prisma, no socket.io. Both the client
// phase sync hook (src/lib/use-phase-sync.ts) and the realtime server
// (src/server/realtime/checkpoint.ts) import from here so a change to
// the synchronized phase order lands in one place rather than two. The
// phases listed for a mode are the only ones the ready check protocol
// gates; personal sub states like module drafting and terminal ones like
// bankruptcy and endgame are personal and never become a harbor
// checkpoint.
//
// The order itself is not stored here. It belongs to the mode, so it
// lives in ./mode.ts beside every other thing that differs between one
// voyage and another, and callers pass the mode in. See that file for
// why Classic and Ocean Gambit do not share a lap.
//
// [B1: the six phase leg, as data] The lap is now the six phases the
// design names, and it is the same six names in both modes: what differs
// between the modes is the order, which is the whole reason the order
// lives on the mode record. A lapped phase is a phase of the leg plus the
// ends a round has rather than stations on it: the pier the lap opens at
// and, in a dealing Gambit build, the draft's seat after it (see lapOrder
// below). Two of the engine's older checkpoints, bartering and artisan
// management, are work inside Parley and Market now rather than steps the
// harbor waits on.

// The order a mode's lap actually walks, switch and all.
//
// [W2: the path draft] A Gambit lap carries the draft's seat between the
// pier and Dawn, because a harbor that deals has a seat it stops at (see
// ./mode.ts). A build with the draft switched off deals nothing, so it has
// no such seat: a captain cannot keep a card the server never drew, and a
// lap that kept the entry anyway would march its harbor into a step whose
// only work is to wait for a settle that can never come. The fold is
// written here rather than into the mode record because the mode record is
// content and the switch is configuration: what the mode says is that a
// dealing build stops at the draft, and this is the one reader that
// applies "unless the deal itself is off" to it.
//
// Every reader of the lap below folds first, so the rank, the successor
// and the round close all agree about the shape of the voyage whichever
// way the switch is set, and a rank computed in one build never has to be
// compared against a rank computed in the other: a harbor reads the switch
// once, when it created the voyage, and never changes it mid sail.

// Where a phase sits on a mode's lap, and how long that lap is.
//
// Every reader below asks this one question, so the shape of a lap is
// written down in exactly one place. The three of them used to each reach
// for modeConfig(mode).checkpointPhaseOrder and call indexOf on it
// themselves, which is the same fact stated three times over and three
// places to change if a lap ever stops being a flat array.
//
// A seat of -1 means the lap does not list that phase at all, which is a
// real answer rather than an error: personal and terminal phases are never
// harbor checkpoints, and each caller below decides for itself what that
// means. Keeping the sentinel visible rather than folding it into a null
// here is what lets closesRound give a plain yes or no.

//
// The one reader that needs the whole list rather than a neighbour or a
// rank is the voyage rail, which draws a step per phase and has to walk
// them. It used to reach into modeConfig(mode).checkpointPhaseOrder
// itself, which is the same fact stated in a fourth place and one more
// caller assuming a lap is something you can filter. Exposed here so that
// stays a fact about this module.

//
// Every lap begins at the pier, which is a lobby rather than a step a
// captain takes, so the first phase after it is where a round actually
// starts: the path draft in a dealing Gambit build, and Dawn in Classic
// and in any build with the deal switched off. It is read off the lap
// rather than named so it stays a property of the lap, and the fold in
// lapOrder above is what makes the same line answer correctly for a
// build that deals and one that does not.
//
// Read as "the first entry that is leg work" rather than as "the second
// entry", which is what it used to be: that only ever worked because both
// laps happened to list the pier first, and a lap that opened anywhere
// else would have opened the harbor on a phase it does not gate.
//
// The server used to write "5" itself when it marked a harbor started,
// which was one more place that knew where the boon draft sits and the
// same trap the round close had: a mode opening somewhere else would have
// opened correctly in the engine and wrongly on the server, and the two
// would have disagreed about a checkpoint from the very first broadcast.

// The pier is the one place on the lap nobody readies out of: the host
// sets sail from there, and the harbor start is a host action rather than a
// vote. Every other lapped phase waits for the harbor. Read from the lap
// rather than from a comparison against the pier by name, so a mode that
// opens its lap somewhere else is described by its own record rather than
// special cased here.

// A single comparable integer for a checkpoint, used to detect when the
// harbor has moved ahead of a given captain (a missed phase:advance
// broadcast) so the client can catch up. Returns null for a phase that
// is not part of the mode's synchronized lap at all, which after the fold
// below is the two terminals and nothing else.
//
// The phase is folded onto the seat it is standing at first (see seatOf),
// and that fold is the difference between a captain inside a personal
// screen being placeable and being invisible. A captain drafting a module
// is standing in the yard, so their rank is Dusk's. Without it they had no
// rank, and every comparison a captain makes against the harbor answered
// null for them: the catch up above would not fire, so a captain whose
// advance frame was dropped while the draft was open could never be
// brought forward again, and a harbor whose vote went unanswered by them had
// no way to read why. One fold, in the one function all four guards call,
// rather than a phase name spelled out at each of them.
//
// The fold is safe against a stale frame because the round term dominates:
// a draft frame from a round the harbor has left still ranks below it, and a
// captain can only be in the draft having come from the round's own Dusk.
//
// The rank is the lap index plus the round times the mode's lap length,
// so a rank only means anything within one mode. Every captain in a harbor
// shares a mode, and the mode is a required argument rather than a global
// read so that stays true for any future caller holding two voyages at
// once.

//
// This is the leg clock. Before it existed, the phase after whichever phase a
// captain was on was written into the engine seven times over, once at the end
// of each transition, and every one of those seven was a second copy of the
// order that this module and ./mode.ts hold. Seven copies of one fact is seven
// chances for a mode to stop being a mode, because a transition that names its
// own successor cannot be told to go anywhere else. Reading the successor here
// instead is what makes two voyages able to run different legs at all.

// mode instead of a fact about the number four, which is what lets a longer
// leg put its own closing phase at the end and still settle correctly. The
// six phase leg calls that phase Dusk, and both modes close there.
//
// Phrased as "it is on the lap, and it is the last one" rather than as a bare
// index comparison so that a mode with an empty lap answers no rather than
// claiming every phase closes the round.

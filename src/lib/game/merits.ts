// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: Captain's Merits
// One time, account wide achievement badges, a third strand of persistent
// progression alongside Renown (see legacy.ts) and Daily Check In (see
// checkin.ts). Pure functions only (no React, no Prisma), so both the
// client (the trophy row in CaptainLegacyCard) and the server (the voyage
// conclusion check in src/server/realtime/conclusion.ts, the only place a
// merit is ever granted) share the exact same rules for what counts.
//
// Unlike Renown XP and Check In rewards, a merit carries no gameplay
// power of its own, purely bragging rights, so this list can grow freely
// without ever touching the voyage economy.

// being baked into the record, because the record is built at import
// time: a t() call written here would answer in whatever language the
// process started in and stay there when a captain switches. Read
// through the accessor, each one composes in the language on screen at
// the moment a tooltip, a toast or the endgame prints it. The four
// descriptions that stand alone stay plain strings.

/**
 * Resolve's shared "I'm short, can someone help" board: a thin relay
 * around the aid:* socket events, kept separate from GameState the same
 * way useBarter is, since an open request is real harbor wide state no
 * single client's deterministic engine can compute on its own. This hook
 * only tracks the board and tells the caller when a loan is granted or
 * repaid; the actual Gold effect (debit the helper, credit the borrower,
 * settle the debt) is the caller's job via the engine functions in
 * src/lib/game/engine.ts.
 *
 * `onGranted` fires once for every loan involving me, on both sides: as
 * the helper (debit my Gold, the request disappears from the board) and
 * as the borrower (credit my Gold, record the debt). The caller tells
 * the two apart from the `role` argument rather than comparing ids itself.
 *
 * `onRepaymentSettled` fires on the client that asked to repay, once the
 * harbor has closed the loan, and it is the only thing that ever moves a
 * debt on this side: the press asks, and the loan is the harbor's to close
 * (a voyage that ended or a seat that was written off can have taken it
 * already, in which case the press is refused rather than answered and
 * nothing here moves). A refusal arrives as this hook's `error`, which is
 * the sentence the member screens draw.

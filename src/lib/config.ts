// missing database URL or a stray character in DATABASE_URL stops the

// surfacing later as a connection that silently goes nowhere.
//
// Server only. The browser bundle never imports this file.

// voyage, which is the default because a table this small has no volume

// is what a practice table, a demo and a test run want.

// The default is 0, the clock switched off, and that is a decision rather
// than a leftover: a seat that ends because a timer says so is a pressure
// rather than a convenience, and a mode is the only thing that can say it
// wants one (see phaseClock on the mode record, which is read first and is
// the whole reason a mode that keeps no clock keeps none). An operator
// default of on would start the clock on every voyage of every mode that
// has one, at tables that never asked for it, so the operator's half of the
// decision defaults to off and PHASE_CLOCK is how a table asks. Nothing
// about the clock is written down, so the switch costs no migration in
// either direction.

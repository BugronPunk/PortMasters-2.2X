// The one tally renderer the harbor's two votes share.
//
// The Manifest Audit and the maroon vote both put a target to the table
// and both show the room who named whom, so both read their nominations
// through this. Not folded into either panel because a second copy of it
// would be a second answer to what a tally row looks like, and the two
// panels would drift the first time one of them learned something the
// other did not: neither of them needs anything this does not do.
//
// Grouped by target rather than counted server side, the same way it was
// when it lived in the audit panel: the names are the part the room
// reads, and the count is arithmetic on a map already in hand. A voter
// who has left the room is not dropped, they are named as a captain,
// which is honest about a name this side no longer has.
//
// The census is the other half of what a captain needs and the half this
// side cannot compute: how many captains the vote is divided by, how many
// names carry it, and who has yet to name anyone. Those arrive on the
// tally frame itself (see AuditTally in @/types/realtime/audit), because
// the roster behind them is the server's own active roster and not the
// member list a client holds.

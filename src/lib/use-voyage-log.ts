// =====================================================================
// The voyage log, client side.
//
// Holds the lines the harbor has written for the voyage this captain is
// sitting in, and asks the server for the ones written before they were
// listening. The public half of the pair: the captain's own channel is
// src/lib/use-private-log.ts, and the two are read side by side at Dusk.
//
// The list is stamped with the harbor it arrived in, the same discipline the
// private channel keeps and for the same reason: a captain who sails from
// one harbor straight into another is never shown a line from the voyage
// they just left. It is emptied on room:restarted, because a restarted
// voyage is a new voyage and the server's own log starts empty with it.
//
// The history is asked for rather than sent on arrival, and that is a
// decision about the socket rather than about the log. A captain carries
// five other subscriptions that ask the server for their state the moment
// the harbor mounts, and this is not a sixth: the only screen that draws a
// log is Dusk, so the request goes out when a captain stands there, and a
// captain who never does costs the server nothing.
//
// Everything off the wire is read through the normalizer in
// src/lib/game/voyage-log.ts, so a frame that is not a line leaves the log
// as it was rather than drawing a blank row.

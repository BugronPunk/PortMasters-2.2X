// =====================================================================
// The marks a failed voyage leaves on a seat, and the questions the two
// ends of the wire ask about them.
//
// Three panels read a captain's marks off the harbor's live status: the
// roster, the fleet ticker, and the maroon vote's list of who may be put
// ashore. Each of them used to spell the rule out for itself, which is
// how the ticker and the roster came to disagree with each other the
// first time the durable flag was added to the phase test, and how the
// vote's list could have offered a target the server would drop.
//
// The same status is read from the server end too, and there it answers
// a question no screen asks: whether a name may be put to the maroon
// vote at all (see recordMaroonVote in src/server/realtime/maroon). So
// the rule is stated once here and imported by both ends rather than
// restated: a status is a phase and the same two optional marks, whether
// it is a client's heartbeat or a finished captain's row.
//
// Pure: a status in, booleans out. The readers below are one question
// each rather than one comparison each, and the two questions that are
// not the same question are deliberately not folded together:
//
//   bankruptMark   the voyage wrote this seat off as bankrupt, by
//                  either signal. Both are read in both modes, because
//                  the two are redundant with each other in Classic
//                  (failSeat writes the flag, and the phase where
//                  bankruptcy is final) and only the flag survives in
//                  Ocean Gambit, where the seat sails on to the endgame
//                  screen with everyone else.
//   writtenOff     bankrupt, marooned, or both: neither may be named in
//                  the maroon vote. What the two marks share is that the
//                  voyage is over for them as a race, while every other
//                  part of the seat stays. The crown is a separate
//                  reading and does not consult this one (see
//                  pickSeaMaster in
//                  src/server/realtime/conclusion/voyage).
//   leftTheVoyage  the voyage is over for this seat: its phase is one of
//                  the two terminals. The marks are deliberately not
//                  read here, which is the difference between the two
//                  readers: an Ocean Gambit bankrupt keeps their seat,
//                  their vote and their lap, so the mark ends their race
//                  without ending their voyage (see
//                  modeConfig.bankruptcyIsFinal in @/lib/game/mode).
//
// Read through the roster as well: the harbor stops counting a seat that
// leftTheVoyage, and keeps counting one that is merely written off (see
// activeRosterSet in src/server/realtime/checkpoint, and
// readFinishedCaptains in src/server/realtime/conclusion/voyage for the
// other end of the same question).

// =====================================================================
// The operator console's socket protocol.
//
// Every account change rides the socket rather than a REST route, and the
// reason is structural: a route handler runs in a different module
// instance from the realtime layer, with its own empty maps, so a route
// could flag an account in the database while the socket layer went on
// holding it as a signed in, seated, playing captain. See the note at the
// top of src/server/realtime/admin.ts.
//
// The roster is never held optimistically. Every action that succeeds is
// answered with the whole roster as it stands afterwards, so the console
// only ever shows what the database actually did, and a refusal leaves the
// previous roster exactly where it was.
//
// An action aimed at a selection is answered the same way, plus a report:
// a selection is allowed to hold accounts the action does not apply to, so
// the console is told what changed and what was left alone.
//
// An answer that never arrives is its own case, and it is the one that used
// to end in a console nobody could use: the rows an action named wait for
// the answer rather than firing twice, so an answer that never comes leaves
// them waiting for good, with the action bar disabled and nothing on screen
// saying why. Two things can eat an answer. The connection can drop, which
// takes the request with it, or the connection can be up while the server
// on the other end does not know the event at all, which is what a running
// dev server looks like after the server half of this feature changed
// underneath it. Both end the same way here: the console stops waiting,
// says nothing can vouch for what happened, and reads the register again,
// because the database is the only thing that knows.

/**
 * The private information scan.
 *
 * Every secret in this game rides a path that was chosen deliberately:
 * an alignment is dealt and delivered by one module, a flourish and an
 * ally travel inside that same delivery, a verdict is written to one
 * captain's own row and printed to the table once, at the reveal. The
 * paths are correct today, and what this script exists for is the day a
 * later slice adds a second one without knowing it was the second.
 * Nothing else in the toolchain would notice: TypeScript does not know
 * which fields are secret, ESLint does not read payloads, and the smoke
 * suite only sweeps the harbors it happens to sail.
 *
 * Eight rules. Each one names a single path and fails when a second
 * appears, and each one is worth a sentence about what it cannot catch,
 * because a gate that reads as stronger than it is is worse than none.
 *
 *   1. One delivery path for a private entry. The event name is handled
 *      in the two files that are the whole channel (the emitter and the
 *      client's one hook) and in the suite that sweeps it. A third file
 *      is a second path nobody reviewed.
 *   2. One reader of the alignment table. Only the module that deals the
 *      cards may read the rows back, so a slice that wants a card has to
 *      ask that module rather than the database.
 *   3. The verdict is a property in four places: the balance reader,
 *      the operator window, the wire type and the combination instrument.
 *      A fifth is a verdict that has learned to travel.
 *   4. No broadcast payload statement names a secret. This one reads the
 *      text of the emit rather than its meaning, so it catches a payload
 *      that says role or flourish or ally or alignment and passes one
 *      that smuggles the same value under another name.
 *   5. The tutorial's one dangerouslySetInnerHTML site. Its string is
 *      authored copy and the only values in it are constants, so the
 *      rule is that no second such site appears in the tree.
 *   6. The roster frame, which is the only thing that carries the mute
 *      list, addressed one captain at a time. A mute is the host's
 *      judgement of one captain, so a roster frame sent to a room is that
 *      judgement told to the room. What it cannot catch is the event name
 *      retyped at the emit or reached through a variable holding it, which
 *      is why the name is written out in full where it is sent.
 *   7. The draft frame, which carries a captain's hand, addressed one
 *      captain at a time. It is the sixth rule's shape for the sixth rule's
 *      reason: a hand is dealt to a seat, so a draft view sent to a room
 *      lays every seat's cards in front of the table. What it cannot catch
 *      is the same thing the sixth rule cannot catch, the event reached
 *      through a variable rather than written at the emit.
 *   8. The bazaar board, which carries one captain's own view of the rumor
 *      rows: a standing row's direction belongs to its publisher until the
 *      market it moves has been drawn, so a board sent to a room channel
 *      hands the whole table the lean the feature exists to keep. It is
 *      the sixth and seventh rules' shape for their reason, and its
 *      emitters are the union of theirs because two files deliver this
 *      frame rather than one. What it cannot catch is what they cannot
 *      catch either, the event reached through a variable holding it,
 *      which is how the client's own hook names it (see
 *      src/lib/use-bazaar-rumors.ts).
 *
 * Rules 1 to 4 are about the server and the client's one hook. They say
 * nothing about the save path, which the review reads by hand and which
 * rule 4 only partly covers: a save blob is written by a client and its
 * fields are judged by the integrity pass rather than by a name here.
 *
 * Run with npm run check:private.

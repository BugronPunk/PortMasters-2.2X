// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: taking the run down again.
//
// The accounts this run signed up, the harbors it opened and the sockets
// it holds are removed here, whether the run passed or threw. The server
// under test keeps its own state, so this talks to the database directly,
// through the same connection the run proved it shared before it created
// anything (see the interlock in ./index.ts).
//
// The captains and the room ids arrive as arguments because they are
// nullable until the article that made them has run, and this has to be
// able to read them either way.

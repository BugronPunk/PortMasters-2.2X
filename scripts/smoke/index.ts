// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: the smoke run, as an order of suites.
//
// Drives one honest voyage through the running app: two captains sign up,
// one opens a harbor, the other joins it by code, both open a socket and
// authenticate, and the run then walks every feature this branch added
// against the same live server, over the same public HTTP and WebSocket
// surface a browser uses.
//
// Start the app first, then in another terminal:
//
//   PHASE_CLOCK=1 npm run dev
//   PHASE_CLOCK=1 npm run test:smoke
//
// PHASE_CLOCK=1 is set on both lines on purpose: the clock suites need
// the server under test to be timing its legs, and the run reads the
// same variable to know which clock it is checking, so one shell
// exports it for both.
//
// Point it somewhere else with SMOKE_BASE_URL, keeping the clock
// variable on the run, for example
// PHASE_CLOCK=1 SMOKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8099 npm run test:smoke
//
// This file is the order, the setup and the teardown, and nothing else.
// Each article of the run lives in ./suites, which is handed what it reads
// and returns what it measured, so what an article depends on can be read
// off its signature rather than worked out from who assigned what earlier
// in one long body.
//
// Five of those values are assigned back into variables declared here
// rather than destructured at the call site: the three captains and the
// two harbor ids the cleanup below has to be able to read, whether the
// run passed or threw.

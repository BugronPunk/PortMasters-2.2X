  // them rather than the screen they are drawn on: the room's log carries
  // what the table already saw and never a hidden thing, and the private

  // socket. That is the plan's own evaluation, a two client assertion
  // that no private entry appears in the other captain's transcript, read
  // here against the surface this slice adds.

  // The vocabulary is checked first and without a server, so a failure
  // further down is never read as a server that declined to write a line.

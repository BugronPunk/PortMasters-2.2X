/**
 * The bug cycle's engine reconciliations, held in one article because
 * they are one shape read at five places: a rule the engine already
 * states somewhere was restated, by hand, where it was needed, and the
 * two copies drifted.
 *
 * The hull taught the lesson first. A module joining a hull ran two
 * incremental lines buried in equipModule while leaving ran an exported
 * function, and the moment a module gained a third door (the Parley
 * trade's buyer side) the arrival lines were the ones it missed, so a
 * traded surcharge module was never charged and its first unwind
 * subtracted a penalty that was never added, which read as a negative
 * bill that paid the captain every Resolve. The fix is one install
 * function every door calls, plus a load that reconciles the two
 * surcharge fields to the hull they are a function of, which heals both
 * directions of the mismatch a shipped build wrote.
 *
 * The rest are the same disease at smaller scale: the load's bare
 * coalesces that never looked at the elements inside a collection (the
 * hull's card records, the whisper board's entries), the ship's own
 * ledger (a NaN fee, a level past the top of its ladder, a fixed cost
 * the tier owns), the pantry's reader asking its table with the in
 * operator, the purse's reader missing the fallback its sibling had, and
 * two log lines quoting a constant or a unit rather than the effect the
 * engine actually applied. Each check below pins the repaired reading
 * and, where the old behavior was a lie a captain could read, pins its
 * absence too.
 *
 * The states are built by hand in the manner of the articles beside
 * this one: no dealer writes a poisoned save for you, and the arithmetic
 * under check is the arithmetic the engine's own doors run on.

// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the status convention.
//
// Every state a captain can see says what it is, why it happened and
// the way back, and the clauses are authored once in
// @/lib/game/status-copy. This article holds the registry to its own
// rules the way the card record's article holds the card pool: first the
// shipped subject passes every clause, which is the run the build itself
// gates on, and then the validator is watched firing against subjects
// built by hand, each carrying the one thing wrong that clause is about,
// because a detector nobody has watched fire is a detector nobody has
// tested.
//
// The clauses it watches fire are the convention's whole argument: an
// emptied clause, a sentence that declares a clause and does not carry
// it, a sentence that drops the way back, and a family whose surfaces no
// longer carry one whole telling between them.
//
// Then the two engine contracts the sentences sit on, checked here so
// they cannot move quietly: the cold's way back is the exact promise the
// smoke suite reads for at the engine's refusal line, and the hunger
// rule quotes the engine's own count rather than a retyped number.
//
// Last, the sweep's guard list itself, held to its contract: every
// family's cause and remedy is guarded, the star's legend is guarded,
// and the states are left out on purpose, because a state is a word
// screens may own and the sentence is what the convention holds.
//
// Nothing here needs a server, a captain or a harbor: the registry is
// static data and its validator is a pure function, so this article runs
// after the run has put its captains away, beside the card record's for
// the same reason.

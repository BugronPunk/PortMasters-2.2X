/**
 * [F7: the power budget and the combination instrument] The plan's third
 * feature of the cycle, in its four halves: the cap that bounds what a
 * captain can hold (the constant and the bounds it is authored between,
 * the two pure reads off the durable set, and every gate at its live
 * site: the two moment tables, the yard roll, the two install paths and
 * the market row), the floor the install paths keep under the panels,
 * the chronicle's held set and the pair matrix reduced off it, and the
 * one home for the bound the conclusion writes.
 *
 * It sits beside the charter article and joins the group that needs no
 * harbor, for the charters' own reason: every gate is a pure function of
 * a state, and the one half that touches a database (the conclusion's
 * column) opens no table of its own. Its fixtures are real pool cards
 * read by name, so the power on them is the arithmetic the live game
 * reads rather than a number typed for the test, and every heavy hull
 * below is a hold the gates could actually have built.
 *
 * The moment and charter reads are exercised with their switches pinned
 * on, the charters' own idiom: a check that read a switch from the
 * ambient environment would report the deployment's rollback as a
 * verdict about the table it is not testing.
 *
 * The instrument half carries the plan's own health check: "its health
 * check is that it fires on a deliberately planted overpowered pair
 * during development", which is the planted pair the matrix rows below
 * are built around, in both of its flags.

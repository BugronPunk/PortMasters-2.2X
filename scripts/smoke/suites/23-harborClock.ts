  // it. Four of them sail the mode the clock belongs to, because the
  // clock is the mode's before it is the operator's: a Classic table has
  // no seat that ends on a timer whatever PHASE_CLOCK says, which is what
  // C, the one harbor below in the founding mode, is here to hold. What
  // A, B, Q and Y differ in is who is still working when the clock runs
  // out:
  //
  //   A: two captains, both aboard, and the leg seat answered by neither:
  //      the clock is the only thing in the room that can end it.
  //   B: two captains and one of them gone once the leg is under way, so
  //      the harbor is not hostage to the laptop that closed.
  //   Q: one captain who reports onto the leg seat and then leaves,
  //      because an empty room is not a table waiting on a straggler and
  //      its clock does not move it.
  //   Y: one captain standing in the yard's own screen when Dusk's clock
  //      runs out, because the fire used to move the room through the
  //      seat and cancel the work under them: this harbor holds the
  //      deadline out one budget, once, and the fire after that moves it.
  //   C: one captain under way in the founding mode, which the clock does
  //      not reach at all, on a server that is timing the others.
  //
  // [W2: the path draft] And all four Gambit harbors are dealt their
  // paths first, because that is where a Gambit voyage opens now: the
  // departure pins each room to the draft's seat, every seat lays its
  // first card the moment it is dealt (the keeper wired into
  // openClockRoom below), and the settle announces the seat's own
  // departure like any other move. The draft's seat carries no clock and
  // is shown none, which is the point of it, so the seats this section
  // times are the ones the leg owns: the first of them opens the moment
  // the room reports itself off the deal, which is the report below every
  // client sends after the settle's frame.
  //
  // What only this section can hold is that the expiry announces the same
  // advance a unanimous ready set announces. The captains here are raw
  // sockets with no engine behind them, so the frame is all this side of
  // the wire can see; the auto commit that frame draws out of a client is
  // held by the browser check, where a page that never clicks still leaves
  // the leg.
  //
  // The budget is read from the phase table and the server's own scale
  // rather than typed in, for the same reason the lap walk reads the lap
  // rather than restating it. Deliberately read as the two inputs rather
  // than through the server's own helper: a budget this section shared

  // The one thing in the realtime layer that decides whether to read a
  // frame. It is checked here rather than
  // in a unit test because what it has to be true of is the app's own
  // client: the budget was read off that client's cadences, and the way
  // to know it is set above them is to run the frames the app itself
  // sends and watch them all land.
  //
  // The budget's own numbers are deliberately not in this file. What is
  // asserted is the shape: a burst the size of the client's tightest loop
  // is answered rather than refused, a flood far above any cadence a
  // captain can produce is cut, the captain behind it is told once, the
  // budget refills, and one socket's flood is not the captain on the
  // next socket's problem.
  //
  // One trap, learned from this probe failing its first full run:
  // presence:update is both the answer to this frame and the news a
  // connect broadcasts to every socket in the tree, so a count of it
  // read on a socket that is only listening counts other captains' news
  // as this captain's answers. The flood is therefore counted on the
  // socket it came from, where it is the loudest thing happening, and
  // the bystanding captain is counted as a difference across their own
  // frames rather than as a total, after a quiet moment that lets the
  // connect this probe caused finish reaching them.

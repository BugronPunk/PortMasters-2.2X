// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the card record.
//
// [F2] The plan's sentence for this goal is one record shape under every
// card, and then the single field that gives the base mode a tighter pool
// and Ocean Gambit a wilder one. What is checked here is the shape half
// first: the plan's ten fields on every record, both language strings
// carried and actually written, and the three readers a card is named
// through. Then the field itself, which is the half with teeth: both
// weightings authored on every card, the ceiling each mode runs, and the
// pool a real captain is drafted from in each mode, because a mode weight
// that nothing reads would pass a check about the records and change
// nothing about the game.
//
// Then the parts the record made possible and the parts it has to keep:
// the five condition arms asked one at a time with the numbers the authored
// cards carry, the lean that weights without filtering, a draw that reads
// the weights rather than the list, the two drafts walked through the
// engine, the tally that measures the offer against the pick, the report
// that reads it, and the save that heals it back.
//
// Last, the validator. Every clause the card check gates the build on is
// watched firing against a subject built by hand carrying the one thing
// wrong that clause is about, because a detector nobody has watched fire is
// a detector nobody has tested.
//
// Nothing here needs a server, a captain or a harbor: the pool is static
// data and its readers are pure functions of a state, so this article runs
// after the run has put its captains away, beside the tag walk's for the
// same reason.

/**
 * The two flag contracts in the load heal, held apart on purpose and
 * asserted in opposite directions.
 *
 * A gate records that a beat already ran (a swap taken, an escort
 * sailed, the raid answered, the broker paid), so it coalesces: a damaged
 * value that still reads truthy keeps the gate closed. Reopening one
 * would let a reload replay a beat the harbor already settled, while a
 * spurious closed gate only costs an option the next leg returns anyway.
 *
 * A mark is a verdict about the captain (the bankruptcy, the maroon, the
 * loan walked away from), so it reads strictly: anything that is not
 * exactly true is not a verdict, because the endgame would otherwise
 * decide a captain's own closing rank off a damaged value. The strict
 * group is the one endGame reads first, which is the reason strictness
 * there is protection rather than tidiness.
 *
 * A change that made the two contracts one would fail this article
 * whichever way it was made, which is the tripwire's whole job.

  // client older than the flags carries the phase and nothing else. The
  // third is the question the marks deliberately do not answer, and the

  // bankrupt is written off for the rest of the voyage and is still
  // counted by the roster, because the mark ends that seat's race and the

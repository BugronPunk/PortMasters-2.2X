// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the mutes and the keys.
//
// This article drives the notification center's rules. Reading the code
// settled which rules exist. There is no dedupe rule and no below the
// breakpoint suppression rule; the rules that are real are these. A
// captain who has
// never opened Settings hears every category, because an absent
// preference answers enabled. The three switches are three keys, so
// muting one category leaves the others alone. Storage that is blocked
// or refuses a write is answered in the captain's favor rather than
// throwing inside a settings screen. And the screen that saves a
// preference and the hook that reads it are looking at the same key,
// because the keys are spelled in exactly one file.
//
// The delivery half of the center (a new bubble replacing the current one
// rather than stacking, a muted category still recorded in the history
// with no unread increment) stays where it already lives: the
// conversation article drives a harbor chat frame end to end through the
// live socket, and the replacement rule is a property of the hook's one
// push rather than of anything a socket surface can observe without a
// page. This article reads the half that is reachable from here, the
// preference functions and the keys, which is the half the defect was
// about: the screen once saved under its own copy of the key names while
// the hook read a set nothing wrote to.
//
// The preference functions answer out of localStorage, so the first half
// swaps a stub in and puts the host's own storage back in the finally
// below, whether or not a check threw. The key half walks src for the
// three literals: each one must live in one file, which is the same
// shape the private information scan reads its single paths through.

  // properties that make it one source of truth, and the naming change it
  // carried, which is the half of this slice a later reader is likeliest
  // to undo by accident.

  // Nothing here talks to the server, because there is no server side to
  // this feature: a path is content, and the module holding it reads no
  // clock, no database and no socket. Every check is also written to
  // survive the day a sixth path is added, because the plan's own
  // evaluation adds one to prove that no other module has to move, and a
  // suite that failed on that edit would itself be the second place the

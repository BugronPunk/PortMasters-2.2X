// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the Supply Barge.
//
// [E1] The anonymous vendor the plan builds as the fail safe for a table
// that never took the Quartermaster: one lot a leg, eight of them at the
// most, at a markup, drawn from the voyage's own numbers so the rule needs
// no state that has to be kept in step. What is checked here is the rule,
// then the reading it feeds: the draw, the sale and its three ceilings,
// the two tallies a voyage leaves behind, the heal that reads a save this
// build did not write, the switch that takes the whole feature away, and
// then the page's own two numbers reduced out of records shaped the way
// the spine writes one.
//
// The wire half of this feature, which is what the record does with the
// pair of counters a captain files, is checked in the spine's own suite
// (32-telemetrySpine) for the reason every other field's claim rule is: one
// place holds what the spine does with a report.

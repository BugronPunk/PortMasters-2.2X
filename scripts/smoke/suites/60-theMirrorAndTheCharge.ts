/**
 * The two display mirrors pricing.ts keeps beside the money it charges.
 *
 * explainTransportCost and explainVAT are, by their own comments, copies
 * of the arithmetic in calcTransportCost and calcVAT: the tooltip gets its
 * own walk so the functions a settlement runs on never have to change to
 * accommodate a panel. The trade is two copies of one sum held together by
 * hand, and nothing in the type system ties a retune on one side to the
 * other. The duplication sweep found the pair while consolidating, and the
 * matrix below found the drift the arrangement had already let in: this
 * mirror reached the harbor's five Gold minimum freight only when a ship
 * level or a flat discount existed to trigger a branch, so a one lot run
 * quoted two Gold freight while the settlement took five, and a card with
 * nothing aboard quoted zero.
 *
 * So this article walks the combinations that actually move each price, a
 * matrix rather than a spot check, and asserts at every point that the
 * mirror's final is the charge. Each mirror then has to prove its matrix
 * is alive: a table where every combination lands on the same number would
 * pass an equality check while testing nothing, so the finals collected
 * below must spread, and each must include the two ends that matter (the
 * floor the transport charge never goes under and the free run a Silk
 * Monopoly promises, the losing sale the VAT charge takes nothing from and
 * the fat one it does).
 *
 * The axes are the ones a captain can hold at once. Transport: the hull's
 * level, the three round flags (a flat discount, the woven goods cut, the
 * charter's per lot cut), the three modules that touch freight (the Hauler,
 * the Overdrive Engine, the Silk Monopoly), the size of the run and
 * whether it carries anything woven. VAT: every product the recipe table
 * holds, the three discounts a sale can ride (the round's own cut, Harbor
 * Credit, the Quiet Account), the Tax Evasion module, and prices from a
 * losing sale to a fat one, because the taxable branch is where the two
 * functions could disagree about what nothing means.

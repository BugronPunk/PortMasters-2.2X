  // the round clock section above already holds to the data. Between them,
  // every seat of both laps is walked by the harbor itself.
  //
  // Each captain here is brand new and holds exactly one socket, which
  // matters rather than being tidy: the status handler ignores a frame
  // from any socket that is not its captain's newest, so a captain with an
  // older live socket would have every report dropped and the walk would
  // stall for a reason that has nothing to do with the lap. The tag is the
  // short half of the two usernames, which are capped well below what a

// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: The seat that waits inside
// the yard.
//
// The field report this article is for: upgrading the ship or changing
// modules incorrectly progresses the voyage to the next phase. The
// mechanism was one missing fold in one roster. A captain inside the
// shipyard's draft or swap screens reports the screen's own phase, and the
// waiting roster asked the lap whether that phase was gated without first
// folding it onto the seat the screen stands inside. A name the lap does
// not list answers no, so the draft captain was dropped from the ready
// check; the moment every remaining captain had voted, the room announced
// the departure, and the draft captain's own client, which folds the seat
// the other way in every guard it has (checkpointRank and the advance
// guard both read seatOf), followed the announcement and autoCommit
// cancelled the draft and left Dusk under their hands. Read from the other
// seat the same frame is the upgrade half of the report: a captain readied
// and the room moved while the mate was still changing modules.
//
// The answer is the fold the lap already states. A captain in the draft or
// the swap is standing at Dusk (PHASE_FACES places both screens inside
// it), so the roster waits on them exactly as it waits on a captain
// standing at the seat itself. The two screens draw the room's bar, so
// the captain being waited on can see the wait and its countdown, and the
// clock still moves a table whose captain never comes back (the fire
// counts the active roster, not this one).
//
// This article holds down both directions, engine first and then over a
// live harbor: the fold reads the way the lap says in both modes, the
// pier and both terminals stay excluded, a ready set minus the draft
// captain moves nothing and keeps the bar whole, an act at the seat
// itself moves nothing, and both votes at the seat still move the room.

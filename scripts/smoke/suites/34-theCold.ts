  // ========== The clothes, and the cold ==========
  // [C3: garments and the cold] One data model for three jobs: a garment
  // is a good with a warmth rating and a durability, a leg carries a
  // weather tag, and the check between them decides who freezes. Four
  // things about that are worth naming before the first assertion.
  //
  // The tag is drawn rather than stored, so what is checked is that it
  // belongs to the harbor rather than to a captain: the same voyage answers
  // the same way on every read, two captains holding different goods read
  // the same leg the same way, and a save carried through a round trip
  // answers it the same way again. That is what lets the forecast be read
  // in the browser with no wire field behind it and no clock in it.
  //
  // The check is read on both sides of its own line. A rule that only ever
  // bit or only ever spared would pass every other check down here, so one
  // cold leg is sailed twice, once bare and once dressed, and the two
  // voyages have to come out differently.
  //
  // The decay is read in the units the plan gives it and read twice in one
  // leg, because a leg opens through more than one path and a wardrobe
  // that decayed twice for one leg is a durability bar the player cannot
  // see moving.
  //
  // And the whole thing is walked once through the engine's own Resolve,
  // for the reason the Larder's reduction is walked through the lap: the
  // plan puts the tick inside settlement on the deterministic resolve
  // step, and a tick that only landed when it was called by name is
  // exactly the defect that check exists to catch.

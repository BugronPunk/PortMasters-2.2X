// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: The Bilingual Harbor.
//
// The article for the language pack and its readers. The pack
// (src/lib/game/i18n/zh.json) is the one file the mapping document lifts
// into the repo: every captain facing string the tree prints, paired
// English to Mandarin, with braces for the values a call site fills in.
// The readers (src/lib/game/i18n/index.ts) are the t / tFor / tId the
// render boundary asks, and this suite holds the two together three
// ways. The book is read independently and held to its own contract
// (pairs of strings, simple tokens, no Mandarin a leaf does not pair, no
// dashes). Every leaf is then walked through the readers and has to come
// back exactly as the book carries it, tokens filled included. And the
// tree is walked for call sites, every literal a t(), tFor() or tId()
// hands over having to exist in the book. That last walk is proven on a
// synthetic file before the real one, so the check the tree passes is a
// check that has been watched fire, which is the same reading
// validateCards takes of its own clauses.
//
// Nothing here opens a harbor: the book and the readers are both in
// process, which is the shape the roster article beside it uses. The
// walk over the tree reads files rather than the live app for the same
// reason the dash checks do: the claim is about the source the ship
// carries, not about one screen somebody happened to open.

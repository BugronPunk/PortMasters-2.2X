// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: The legacy phase that moves.

/**
 * The load heal's phase step and the advance's own read of it, held to
 * each other: a save written under an older build carries a phase token
 * this build no longer names ("3", "barter", "worker_mgmt"), and both a
 * load and a press of the advance have to move as the phase the token
 * means. Left raw, the token falls through nextPhase's default with
 * nothing advancing while the ready check refuses the seat, which is the
 * wedge this article exists to keep closed. The contract itself (the
 * legacy table and the heal moving together) is the contract this article
 * holds; what is held here is the moving.
 *
 * The two live faces are here for the other half: a save written mid
 * yard carries a phase that is real, and the heal must pass it through
 * rather than reading it as a token it does not know.
 *
 * A harbor opens nothing: every read below is a pure function of a state
 * in process, which is why this article can sit with the engine group.

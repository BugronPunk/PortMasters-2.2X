// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the ready check that stalls.
//
// The field report this article is for is one sentence long: both captains
// clicked ready in a Gambit harbor and the voyage did not proceed. The
// protocol answers that sentence with one shape, and this article holds
// both halves of it down.
//
// The first half is the vote. A harbor advances when every captain in the
// active roster has said ready, and what each vote promises is a
// departure: the client hears the harbor move, runs its transition and
// reports the seat it landed on, and that report is what moves the
// checkpoint. A vote whose departure cannot leave the seat it is cast
// from, or a departure whose report never lands, leaves the harbor holding
// a full ready set and a lock nobody can lift: the bar reads ready on
// every screen and nothing moves. So the engine's answer to "can this
// press leave this seat" is checked here seat by seat, against both laps,
// because that answer is what the bar and every panel's own button now
// gate their press on.
//
// The second half is the harbor's own cure, and it is the half that has to
// be watched over a live harbor rather than read: an announcement the
// harbor never hears answered is handed back to the table after a grace
// longer than the client's own heartbeat, with the honest votes kept and
// the lock cleared, so the next report can announce the same seat again.
// Both directions are checked, because the cure that fired on a healthy
// table would be a second bug: a harbor whose report lands is never spoken
// to at all.
//
// What this article deliberately does not check is the press sites
// themselves, which are React panels. The engine's answer they gate on is
// here, the server's half is here, and the two of them together are what
// the client model outside the repository was run against to prove the
// field report closed.

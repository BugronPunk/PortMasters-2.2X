// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: The wage the bill quotes.

/**
 * One roster, one bill, five readers: payWages charges it, and four
 * surfaces quote it (the settle sheet, the bench payroll, the advice
 * line, the left rail). Each of the four used to walk the roster itself,
 * and none of them knew about the Jade Pavilion pledge, so a pledged
 * captain was billed exactly one wage too many: the settle button warned
 * of a bankruptcy the run would never deliver and the harbor aid request
 * was seeded with a shortfall that did not exist. What is settled here is
 * the reader all five now share: the figure it quotes before the run is
 * the figure the run charges, the pledge is spent on exactly one run,
 * and a trade whose only hand is sponsored reads as owing nothing while
 * still reporting why.
 *
 * The states below are built by hand in the manner of the order
 * settlement beside this article: no dealer writes a pledged hire for
 * you, and the arithmetic under check is the arithmetic the engine's own
 * paths run on.

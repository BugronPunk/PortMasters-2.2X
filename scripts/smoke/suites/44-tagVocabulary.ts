// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the tag vocabulary.
//
// [F1] The plan's sentence for this goal is that no effect ever names an
// item key, and the vocabulary it names things from instead is twelve
// closed words. What is checked here is the wording half of that goal:
// which twelve, what each one means, which entries carry which, and that
// a caller can ask the question an effect will ask. Then the rule half,
// which is the half the plan insists on rather than trusts: the two tag
// maximum is held by validation at load time rather than by review, and
// every one of the nine things that validation states is watched firing
// here, against a subject built by hand carrying the one thing wrong that
// rule is about. A check that has only ever printed ok has never been
// shown to be able to print anything else, and a detector nobody has
// watched fire is a detector nobody has tested.
//
// Nothing here needs a server, a captain or a harbor: the content is
// static data and the rule is a pure function of it, so this article runs
// after the run has put its captains away, beside the vendor's for the
// same reason.
//
// What it deliberately does not check is the scan the plan puts in G4,
// which is the one that walks the shipped cards for a named good. That
// goal owns the content validator's home, and the cards that still name a
// good are its first customers rather than this goal's leftovers: they
// are listed in the plan as the work of F2.

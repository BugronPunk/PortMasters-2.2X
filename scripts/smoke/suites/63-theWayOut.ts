// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the way out.
//
// The harbor's two exits a captain can reach from a seat they cannot
// move: the Leave press, which asks before it writes a seat off once the
// voyage is under way, and the finished voyage screens, which offer a
// captain waiting on the host a way to set out for a new harbor instead.
//
// Nothing here needs a server, a captain or a harbor: both exits are
// shapes in the client source, held to their wiring rather than to a
// live harbor, the same way the mutes and the keys' article walks src for
// its key literals. What it holds is that the leave press routes through
// one guard before it commits the write off, that the confirm it opens
// is the harbor's own dialog wired back to the leave flow rather than to a
// second one, and that the two finished voyage screens take their way
// out from the harbor instead of drawing a press that goes nowhere.

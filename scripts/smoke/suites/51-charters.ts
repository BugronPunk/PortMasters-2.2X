/**
 * A voyage offers one charter at the fourth round, a trio of the captain's
 * two path charters and one wildcard, and the one they take carries for
 * the rest of the voyage. What is checked here is the feature end to
 * end: the vocabulary and the ten cards, the three pure reads that
 * derive the moment, the answer and its refusals, every flag the ten
 * write read at its live site, the save healed back, the take the wire
 * files once per voyage, and the barrel's one public name.
 *
 * It sits beside the milestone boons' article and joins the group that
 * needs no harbor, for the same reasons: the moment is a pure function
 * of a state, and the one half that touches the database (the
 * accumulator the round report feeds) opens no table of its own. The
 * voyage schedule's chartered waves share the noun, which is why every
 * captain facing string here says charter in the possessive the screen
 * uses.

/**
 * The settlement's two guarded reads, both about a card the type allows
 * and the dealers never write: a resource line may arrive without a
 * count (ResourceRef.required is optional), and a product card may carry
 * no resource lines at all. The shortfall check above the settlement has
 * always read a missing count as a missing need; the settlement used to
 * read the same absence with a non null assertion, subtracting an
 * undefined and poisoning every number the hold reports afterward, and
 * the product VAT block indexed the line it taxed without asking whether
 * a line existed.
 *
 * Both cards below are dealt onto a fresh state by hand because no
 * dealer can write them, which is the point rather than a shortcut: the
 * guards exist for the shapes a save can carry, and the holds here are
 * read back as numbers to prove the settlement keeps them numbers.

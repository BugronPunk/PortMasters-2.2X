// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: the fleet's own outcome.
//
// The field report this article is for: the reveal put "Did not win" under
// a captain whose personal goal the voyage had cleared, while the ledger
// painted beside them both said the commission was Filled. The mechanism
// was one fact read in the wrong place. The met flag each row carried was
// decided from what that captain's own client had written down, and a
// client that missed the final round, reloaded through it or joined late
// ends holding a record that stops short of the fill. The row then said
// unmet while the ledger under it, which merges every captain's record by
// max per good per round, painted Filled. Read from the rule's own contract
// (see victory.ts), the flag was never a per captain fact: the card
// promises the fleet's goal, so the caller computes the answer once for
// the voyage and writes the same one to every row.
//
// The answer is readFleetMet (see conclusion/finishers.ts): the merge the
// ledger already draws, decided once and handed to every verdict and every
// row. This article holds down the arithmetic under it and both branches
// live:
//
//   - a voyage where exactly one client kept the round that filled the
//     commission. Every row reads met, the captain whose own record stops
//     short wins the card the fix restored, and the frame, the rows and a
//     merge recomputed here by hand all tell one story;
//   - a voyage where no client kept a record at all. Every row reads
//     unmet, and the Pirate card pays for the first time in a concluded
//     voyage: a pirate who ends solvent and standing wins the failure,
//     which is the branch no earlier article's fixture could reach because
//     every one of them filled the commission.
//   - a voyage whose purse the conclusion's own sweeps pay out after the
//     verdict was once read. The open venture force failed at the close
//     refunds its half, the client reports the settled total the way its
//     own beacon would, and the purse goal the finished total missed by
//     ten is won on the total the captain actually ends holding.

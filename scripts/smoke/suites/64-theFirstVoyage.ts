// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: The first voyage.
//
// W5's article. What a new captain meets before the first market, held to
// the records the surfaces read: the guide rows the three path surfaces
// print, the tutorial's path page, the manual's path page, and the two
// lines the draft and the Welcome screen state. Nothing here opens a
// harbor: the surfaces are functions and source, so the article sits with
// the pure cluster at the run's end.

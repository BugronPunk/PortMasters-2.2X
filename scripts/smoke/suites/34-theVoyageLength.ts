// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release, smoke run: The voyage's length, and
// the table that sails it.
//
// Goal I5, which the launch gate beside it asked for: a mode that runs a
// different voyage pins its own number on its own record, and a four
// captain harbor has to sail the whole of it and be paid into the
// chronicle as a four seat voyage.
//
// The article carries the checks that decide the length and the article
// that drives the table, because the two are the same claim read from
// two sides: the number the mode pins and the voyage that number buys.

  // [I5: session length, and table size] The plan makes the mode's length
  // a configuration restriction rather than a system of its own: the
  // ladder stays the founding mode's, and a mode that runs a different
  // voyage pins its own number on its own record. What is checked here is
  // that the pin is read through the one selector, that the state a
  // captain is handed carries it, that the copy a captain reads quotes
  // the voyage rather than the tier, and that a four captain harbor sails
  // the twelve legs to the end and is paid into the chronicle as a four
  // seat voyage. Four is also the smallest table the mode deals a
  // hidden card into, so the last fixture is the plan's "four has to be
  // genuinely good rather than a degraded mode" read end to end.

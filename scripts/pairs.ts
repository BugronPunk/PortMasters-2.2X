/**
 * The combination report.
 *
 * [F7: the combination instrument] The plan's evaluation for this goal is
 * one reading per pair: win rate by combination, with any pair past a
 * threshold share of wins flagged automatically, because "with forty
 * boons, twenty modules and ten charters the pair matrix is far past what
 * anyone can hand test". This prints every pair the finished voyages have
 * carried, off the held sets the conclusion writes into the chronicle,
 * through the reader in src/lib/game/combinations.ts.
 *
 * Run with npm run report:pairs, against whichever database DATABASE_URL
 * names at the time. It only reads.
 *
 * The plan's nightly simulation harness (both sides played without
 * humans) is recorded unbuilt in the plan's Iteration section, so the
 * nightly run the flag is meant for is this report, run by the operator
 * and read as a recorded reading: the flags on this table are what a
 * balance pass would open with, and a pair below the appearance floor
 * prints its count and no rate, for the conversion report's own reason
 * (the count is what decides whether the rate means anything).

/**
 * The launch gate report.
 *
 * Prints the sixteen launch gates against the window the balance
 * dashboard reads (src/server/telemetry-window.ts, the last three hundred
 * Ocean Gambit voyages on this database), and with them the ship decision
 * taken by src/lib/game/gates.ts. The run's own claim is
 * that every one of the sixteen is in band over at least three hundred
 * recorded voyages, and a claim of that shape has to be readable without
 * opening a browser and without writing a query.
 *
 * Run with npm run report:gates, against whichever database DATABASE_URL
 * names at the time. It only reads.
 *
 * The exit code is the verdict rather than an accident, so the command can
 * stand in a release gate: 0 the mode is clear to ship, 1 it is held by a
 * gate that is out of band, 2 no verdict can be given yet, 3 the report
 * could not be read at all. Anything that is not a clear ship is a failure
 * of the command, which is the direction to fail in.
 *
 * A gate with no source prints as no source rather than as 0, because a
 * system still to build is not a number that is doing badly, and a report
 * that flattens the two is the kind of instrument that agrees with
 * whatever it is pointed at.

/**
 * The closed test guard.
 *
 * The closed test is thirty players, none of them the people who built the
 * mode, on a database that has never held a real account. Its discipline is
 * that it runs on a separate database from anything with real accounts, and
 * the only part of that a script can check is the name. So this checks the
 * name, out loud, before anybody is invited.
 *
 * One rule. The database this process resolves has to be a local file
 * whose name begins with closed-test. Everything else is refused: the
 * project's own databases, a Postgres URL, and a local file with any
 * other name. The refusal prints the file's own name and nothing else of
 * any URL, ever, because a connection string can carry a password inside
 * it and this script's output is meant to be pasted into a session log.
 *
 * What it does not do, and why, because a gate that reads as stronger
 * than it is is worse than none:
 *
 *   It does not contact a running server. It cannot, usefully: the one
 *   route a script can call without credentials is /api/health, which
 *   answers { status: "ok" } and touches nothing else by design, so it
 *   has no way to say which database the server answering for it is
 *   writing to. Asking would be theatre. The real proof that a server
 *   and the script driving it share one database happens at run time,
 *   and it already exists: the smoke suite refuses to clean up after
 *   itself until it has read back, through its own connection, the
 *   first account the server just wrote (scripts/smoke/, the safety
 *   interlock). That is the check to point at while the closed test is
 *   actually being driven.
 *
 *   It does not stop anyone from inviting players. Nothing can. What it
 *   does is put the name of the database on the screen beside a count of
 *   what is already in it, so the invitations go out from somebody who
 *   just read both.
 *
 * It reads and it counts. It writes no row and creates no table, and
 * that posture is the same at both exits, pass or refuse.
 *
 * Run with npm run check:closed-test.

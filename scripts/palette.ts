/**
 * The palette check.
 *
 * This file owns the widget table: every colour bearing surface on the
 * front end, the hue it was given, and the screens it appears on. The
 * table is the source of truth, and palette.css is checked against it
 * rather than the other way round.
 *
 * Six things have to hold, and each one has a way of going wrong that
 * nothing else in the toolchain would notice. TypeScript does not read
 * colours, ESLint does not read class strings, and the smoke test only
 * asks whether the pages answer.
 *
 *   1. Two widgets a captain sees at the same time are at least MIN_GAP
 *      degrees apart. Closer than that and two different panels read as
 *      the same panel.
 *   2. No identity hue sits that close to the red that means danger,
 *      cost and error. A heading in that red reads as a warning.
 *   3. Every widget in the table has a token, and every token belongs to
 *      a widget. Neither list may drift from the other.
 *   4. Every pm-grad- class used in src/ has a rule to fill it. A class
 *      with no rule leaves the element with no background at all, which
 *      is silent in every other check.
 *   5. Every bright fill has an ink that can be read on it. A gradient
 *      is written in CSS and an ink in a className, so nothing connects
 *      the two unless this check does.
 *   6. No raw Tailwind palette class is left in src/. A tree that still
 *      has them has two colour systems in it.
 *
 * Rules 1 and 2 are one pass over the table and share checkDistances
 * below, so the six rules are five checks.
 *
 * Run with npm run check:palette.

     hues are handed out on a stride rather than in page order, so two

     wheel. The activity rung at 290.9 left this ladder on 2026-10-04,

     other as it stands, and retuning the floor to one piece of slack
     would buy nothing a captain can see. A new Lobby surface still has to
     earn its rung here.

     push a guide that shares their screen to 70 or below, or to 131 or
     above. The Lobby ladder is eleven rungs, so the guide is also
     boxed in by the two rungs beside it and may sit only between 96.3
     and 109.9. Those two ranges do not meet, so there is no hue on the

     Charter at 210.4 and Sailing at 264.1, with Chat at 240 sitting in

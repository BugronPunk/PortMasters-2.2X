// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2.2 Parallel Release: application entry point.
//
// One process, one port, one server. This file builds a single Node HTTP
// server and hands it to two things:
//
//   Next.js, which serves the page and every route under /api, and
//   the realtime layer in src/server/realtime, which mounts Socket.IO
//   on /socket.io of the very same server.
//
// Because both live on one listener, the browser fetches the site, calls
// the API and opens its socket on the same origin. There is no gateway
// in front, no second port to forward, and nothing to keep in step. The
// one listener works because attaching Socket.IO takes over the request
// listener and hands anything that is not /socket.io straight back to
// Next, which is why no routing code for that split appears anywhere in
// this repo.
//
// Run it with `npm run dev` while working, or `npm run build` followed by
// `npm run start` for the production build.
//
// Two things are imported late, on purpose. The environment is validated
// before the database client is built, so a bad value stops the server
// with a readable message instead of an error thrown from module loading.
// The realtime layer, and the database handle it pulls in with it, are
// therefore loaded inside main() rather than at the top of the file.
// =====================================================================

// Must stay first: puts .env into process.env before anything reads it.
